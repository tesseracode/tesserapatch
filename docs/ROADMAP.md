---

## M0 — Bootstrap ✅

**Goal**: Go module, CLI skeleton, build pipeline.

See `docs/milestones/M0-bootstrap.md` for task list.

## M1 — Core Store & Init ✅

**Goal**: `.tpatch/` data model, `init`, `feature add`, `status`, `config`.

See `docs/milestones/M1-core-store.md` for task list.

## M2 — Provider & Analysis ✅

**Goal**: Provider abstraction, `provider check`, `analyze`, `define`, `explore` with heuristic fallback.

See `docs/milestones/M2-provider-analysis.md` for task list.

## M3 — Apply & Record ✅

**Goal**: Deterministic apply recipe, `implement`, `apply`, `record`, patch capture (tracked + untracked).

See `docs/milestones/M3-apply-record.md` for task list.

## M4 — Reconciliation ✅

**Goal**: 4-phase reconciliation (`reconcile`), `upstream.lock`, provider-assisted semantic detection.

See `docs/milestones/M4-reconciliation.md` for task list.

## M5 — Skill System ✅

**Goal**: 6 harness formats embedded, CLI-driven installation, parity guard test.

See `docs/milestones/M5-skill-system.md` for task list.

## M6 — Bug Bash Validation ✅

**Goal**: Pass the reconciliation bug bash end-to-end against tesseracode/copilot-api.

**Result**: Full pass. Feature A → upstream_merged (Phase 3), Feature B → reapplied (Phase 4 with 3-way merge). All 26 tests pass, typecheck clean. See `../tests/tpatch/BUG-BASH-REPORT.md`.

See `docs/milestones/M6-bug-bash.md` for task list.

---

## Future Milestones (Post-MVP)

## M7 — Provider Investigation & Integration ✅

**Goal**: Evaluate Ollama, OpenRouter, and Anthropic as provider options. Implement the best candidate.

**Result**: Anthropic Messages API adapter added alongside the existing OpenAI-compatible provider. Ollama and OpenRouter confirmed to work with the existing provider. Auto-detection extended. See `docs/adrs/ADR-002-provider-strategy.md`.

See `docs/milestones/M7-provider-investigation.md` for task list.

## M8 — LLM Output Validation & Retry ✅

**Goal**: Structured validation of LLM responses, retry with corrective feedback, quality metrics.

**Result**: `GenerateWithRetry` helper with per-phase validators (JSON for analyze/implement, non-empty for define/explore). Raw responses logged to `artifacts/raw-<phase>-response-N.txt`. Config key `max_retries` + `--no-retry` CLI flag.

See `docs/milestones/M8-llm-validation.md` for task list.

## M9 — Interactive Mode & Harness Integration ✅

**Goal**: `tpatch cycle --interactive` for human-driven flow + `tpatch next` protocol for harness-backed (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, OpenCode) integration.

**Result**: `cycle`, `test`, `next` commands shipped. `tpatch next --format harness-json` emits structured tasks (phase, instructions, context_files, on_complete). `tpatch test <slug>` runs the configured `test_command` and records validation status. All 6 skill formats updated, parity guard extended. Harness integration guides for codex (`docs/harnesses/codex.md`) and Copilot CLI (`docs/harnesses/copilot.md`) written.

See `docs/milestones/M9-interactive-harness.md` for task list.

## Refinement (2026-04-17) — SDK evaluation + presets + tracking cadence ✅

**Goal**: Evaluate OpenRouter/OpenAI/Anthropic Go SDKs and codex/copilot-cli harnesses; adopt the simplest integration with proven parity; strengthen tracking cadence.

**Result**: No third-party provider SDKs adopted (stdlib suffices for our narrow `Check`+`Generate` surface). Added `tpatch provider set --preset` for one-line vendor switching. Wrote harness integration guides for codex and Copilot CLI. Rewrote AGENTS.md context-preservation rules with a per-trigger cadence cheatsheet. See `docs/adrs/ADR-003-sdk-evaluation.md`.

## Distribution (2026-04-17) — `go install` + CI workflow + v0.3.0 release ✅

**Goal**: Make `go install github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/cmd/tpatch@latest` work and add a free CI workflow.

**Result**: Renamed the module path to match the repo (`github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch`). Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (matrix ubuntu+macOS, `go-version-file: go.mod`, gofmt/vet/build/test/install smoke). Tagged `v0.3.0` locally; ready to push.

## Planning (2026-04-17) — Native Copilot auth research + PRD ✅

**Goal**: Plan a "native" Copilot auth provider. Confirm whether the existing `copilot-api` proxy is officially supported and whether `github/copilot-cli` is open source.

**Result**: Confirmed `copilot-api` is reverse-engineered and explicitly unsupported by GitHub; confirmed `github/copilot-cli` is closed-source (only README/install/changelog/LICENSE published). Wrote `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md` with a two-phase recommendation (M10 managed proxy, M11 opt-in native PAT provider). Shelling out to the `copilot` CLI is explicitly rejected — it burns premium requests and re-runs its own agent loop. M11 is soft-blocked on a ToS question (can tpatch send editor headers against `api.githubcopilot.com`?).

## M10 — Managed Copilot Proxy UX ✅ (delivered 2026-04-17, pending review)

**Goal**: One-command access to GitHub Copilot via the `ericc-ch/copilot-api` proxy, without tpatch taking on process-supervision responsibilities. **See ADR-004 for the locked-in decisions.**

**Scope**: Global config file at `~/.config/tpatch/config.yaml` (XDG-honouring; macOS defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/tpatch/config.yaml`), reachability probe (`GET /v1/models`, 2s timeout), warn-but-continue on `init`/`provider set`, hard-fail on workflow commands (`analyze|define|explore|implement|cycle`), first-run AUP warning persisted once per user, no log piping, Windows deferred.

**Delivered**:
- `internal/store/global.go` + `types.go::CopilotAUPAckAt`
- `internal/provider/probe.go` (`Reachable`, `IsLocalEndpoint`, `IsCopilotProxyEndpoint`)
- `internal/cli/copilot.go` + `cobra.go::loadAndProbeProvider`
- CI release automation in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (tag-triggered GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`, free)
- Tests in `internal/store/global_test.go` (6) and `internal/provider/probe_test.go` (5)
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` refresh

**Opt-out**: `TPATCH_NO_PROBE=1` for offline/CI steps.

## M11 — Native Copilot Provider (opt-in) ✅ (delivered, pending review)

**Goal**: First-party Go provider speaking directly to `api.githubcopilot.com` — port of the copilot-api/litellm pattern (session-token exchange via `copilot_internal/v2/token`). Removes the Node/Bun dependency. **See ADR-005 for the locked-in decisions.**

**Blueprint**: ericc-ch/copilot-api's `src/lib/api-config.ts` + `src/services/github/` — client ID `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`, VS Code Copilot Chat editor headers, session-token refresh on ~25-min cadence. ~350–400 LOC of Go.

**Gate**: Requires `provider.copilot_native_optin: true` in global config + acceptance of AUP warning. Editor-header policy ships as-is; will switch to an official compatibility endpoint once GitHub documents one.

**Delivered**:
- `internal/provider/copilot_{auth,login,headers,native}.go` — device-code flow, session-token exchange, on-disk auth store (0600, atomic write, symlink-reject), editor headers matching copilot-api 0.26.7, 401-retry-once semantics.
- CLI: `tpatch provider copilot-login`, `copilot-logout`, `--preset copilot-native`, opt-in gate enforced in `provider set` + `config set`.
- `docs/faq.md` (macOS config-path note, auth-file locations).
- Harness doc updated with "Native path (experimental)" section.

**Opt-in**: `tpatch config set provider.copilot_native_optin true` → `tpatch provider copilot-login` → `tpatch provider set --preset copilot-native`.

## M12 — Provider-Assisted Conflict Resolver ✅ (Tranche B2, v0.5.0)

**Goal**: Phase 3.5 of reconcile — when 3-way merge fails, provider resolves each conflicted file in a shadow `git worktree`. Validation gates output; accept/reject is atomic.

**Scope doc**: `docs/milestones/M12-provider-conflict-resolver.md` (PRD: `docs/prds/PRD-provider-conflict-resolver.md`, ADR: `docs/adrs/ADR-010-provider-conflict-resolver.md`)

**Ships**: shadow worktree plumbing, per-file sequential resolver, Go-in-tree + configurable syntax validation, `reconciling-shadow` state, 6-skill update, ≥5 golden scenarios.

**Out of scope** (v0.5.x follow-ups): parallel calls, chunked context for huge files, opt-in heuristic fallback, auto spec-drift refresh.

## M13 — UX Polish & Quick Wins (Tranche C1, v0.5.1) ✅

## M13.5 — Correctness Fix Pass (Tranche C2, v0.5.2) ✅

Six confirmed findings from the v0.4.3..v0.5.1 delta review, shipped as a focused correctness-only release before starting M14.

- c2-resolve-apply-truthful — silent correctness bug on `reconcile --resolve --apply` (shadow → real tree copy was never happening for auto-apply). Fix: shared `workflow.AcceptShadow` helper used by both manual and auto paths.
- c2-refresh-index-clean — `DiffFromCommitForPaths` no longer leaks intent-to-add entries (uses `GIT_INDEX_FILE` temp index).
- c2-recipe-hash-provenance — stale guard now detects recipe content drift (sha256), not only HEAD drift. Legacy sidecars still accepted.
- c2-remove-piped-stdin — piped stdin auto-confirms remove, matching shipped v0.5.1 contract.
- c2-amend-append-flag — new `amend --append`; replace stays default; mutex with `--reset`.
- c2-max-conflicts-drift — 8 doc sites corrected to match runtime default of 10.

8 regression tests added. Code-review verdict: APPROVED. See `docs/supervisor/LOG.md`.

## M13.6 — Shadow Accept Accounting Fixes (Tranche C3, v0.5.3) ✅

Three external-reviewer findings on the v0.5.2 shadow-accept flow, shipped as a focused correctness release before M14.1.

- c3-separate-resolution-artifact — dual-writer schema collision on `reconcile-session.json` split into `resolution-session.json` (resolver-owned) + `reconcile-session.json` (reconcile summary). Manual `reconcile --accept` works again post-shadow-awaiting.
- c3-accept-stamps-reconcile-outcome — `AcceptShadow` now stamps `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied`. Unblocks ADR-011 D6 label composition.
- c3-manual-accept-regression-test — `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow` end-to-end guard.

Code-review verdict: APPROVED. See `docs/supervisor/LOG.md`.

**Goal**: Low-risk, high-daily-use-impact improvements. 8 items: apply default mode, stdin add, progress spinner, editor integration, feature amend/remove, recipe stale guard, record lenient mode.

**Scope**: Inline — no separate milestone file for polish tranches.

## M14 — Feature Dependencies / DAG (Tranche D, v0.6.0) ✅

**Goal**: Stacked / dependent features with hard vs soft semantics, topological reconcile, composable derived labels (`waiting-on-parent` + `blocked-by-parent`), cascade-remove, and amend-invalidation tracking.

**PRD**: `docs/prds/PRD-feature-dependencies.md` (commit `fa4bbb6`) — APPROVED WITH NOTES after 3 review cycles.

**ADR**: `docs/adrs/ADR-011-feature-dependencies.md` — **REQUIRED before M14.1 coding starts**. Locks 8 architectural decisions (storage in status.json, DFS cycle detection, Kahn traversal, labels-not-states, created_by hard-only, upstream_merged satisfies deps, cascade on remove, no parent-patch injection to M12 resolver in v0.6).

**Gated by**: `features.dependencies: true` config flag (default false) until M14.4 lands. Single atomic v0.6.0 flip — no half-shipped intermediate releases.

**Scope (4 sub-milestones, ~1350 LOC total)**:
- **M14.1** — data model + validation (~300 LOC). Dependency struct, cycle DFS, 5 validation rules. ✅ APPROVED (commits `02f1ba9`, `d166281`, `7dd5941`).
- **M14.2** — apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout (~250 LOC). Coordinated atomic change to recipe schema + all 6 skill formats + `docs/agent-as-provider.md`. ✅ APPROVED (commits `24baf92`, `9a5f2f3`, `4dfe0f1`, `cdd5484`). **Note**: the apply-time `created_by` integrity gate was not wired in M14.2 — closed in the M14 correctness pass below.
- **M14.3** — reconcile topological traversal + composable labels + compound verdict (~500 LOC). Kahn planner, label composition matrix, `blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution` compound verdict, M12 interaction. ✅ APPROVED (commits `7c9aee4`, `bccf5e2`, `b9efd07`, `a232a7b`, `4e39384`).
- **M14 correctness pass** — three external-reviewer findings before the M14.4 cutover. F1 (HIGH, was cutover-blocking): wire `created_by` apply-time gate via new `ErrPathCreatedByParent` sentinel, closing the M14.2 gap. F2: clear stale-parent-applied label after a clean reconcile (label/AttemptedAt consistency). F3: suppress parent-derived labels when child outcome is `ReconcileUpstreamed`. ✅ APPROVED (commits `cbe2873`, `071c5ed`, `cc95cbb`, `1e0d064`).
- **C5 fix-pass** — re-review caught two real gaps in the correctness pass. F1 (HIGH): F3 only fired on already-persisted upstreamed status, not the in-flight reconcile-time persistence path; fixed by short-circuiting label composition in `saveReconcileArtifacts` on `result.Outcome ∈ childRetiredOutcomes`. F2 (MEDIUM): PRD §4.3 contract drift — dry-run was erroring on hard-parent `created_by` misses; now downgrades to a warning while apply still errors. ✅ APPROVED (commits `c84c7a6`, `dd72c2c`, `ea94fb7`).
- **M14.4** — user-facing cutover (~1100 LOC across 7 chunks A–G). Chunk A: `tpatch status --dag` (ASCII + `--json`, scoped + full, cycle-safe). Chunk B: `features_dependencies` default flipped to true. Chunk C: `tpatch feature deps` verb tree + `amend --depends-on/--remove-depends-on` + `remove --cascade` (with the `--force ≠ bypass` rule per PRD §3.7 / ADR-011 D7). Chunk D: status-time `ValidateAllFeatures` warnings inline. Chunk E: 6-skill rollout with `created_by` reframed as live apply-time gate. Chunk F: `docs/dependencies.md` user reference. Chunk G: v0.6.0 release (version bump, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP). Tag is supervisor's closeout action. ✅ implementation complete (commits `d1aca5f`, `ca23b35`, `5d5f594`, `97a994f`, `e0a7d47`, plus this release commit).

**Out of scope** (v0.6.x follow-ups): auto-rebase on parent drift (`feat-feature-autorebase`), parent-patch context for resolver (`feat-resolver-dag-context`), per-dep version ranges (`feat-patch-compatibility`), stacked-PR delivery (`feat-delivery-modes`).

## M15 Wave 3 — Verify freshness overlay (v0.6.2) ✅

Successor to the superseded `feat-feature-tested-state` design (ADR-012).
Replaced the tested-as-state model with a Git-like freshness overlay per
ADR-013 / PRD-verify-freshness.md after external review surfaced
lifecycle/freshness conflation. Lifecycle and verification stay separate.

- **Slice A** — `tpatch verify <slug>` cobra shell + V0-V2 real + V3-V9
  stubs + minimal `Verify` sub-record + minimal EXPERIMENTAL skill
  stubs. ✅ APPROVED WITH NOTES (commits `8e2aabe`-`bce2252`,
  ~2026-04-27).
- **Slice B** — `ReconcileLabel` extension + `composeLabelsFromStatus`
  freshness derivation + `tpatch status` / `--dag` / `--json`
  rendering + `tpatch amend` invalidation + truth-table tests.
  ✅ APPROVED (commits `a07acc7` original + `53a4d9a` revision-1
  fixing amend invalidation dead-branch reproduced live by external
  supervisor, ~2026-04-28).
- **Slice C** — V3-V9 real implementations including hard-parent
  topological closure replay (V7/V8). ✅ APPROVED (commits `32f50c8`
  original + `5892ae0` revision-1 fixing V8-must-run-on-closure-replayed-baseline-when-recipe-absent-but-patch-present
  + `23af23e` revision-2 fixing V8-precondition-is-file-presence-not-non-empty-content,
  ~2026-04-29).
- **Slice D** — `tpatch verify --all` + 6-skill rollout + parity-guard
  anchors + `docs/dependencies.md` cross-link + CHANGELOG v0.6.2.
  ✅ APPROVED (commits `19271f7` original + `67730de` revision-1
  surfacing-malformed-status-as-error-row + `e7f8661` revision-2
  ENOENT-vs-stat-error-split + `d390322` revision-3
  workspace-corruption-on-missing-features-dir + `fa93536` revision-4
  defensive-3-way-branch-on-tpatch-stat, ~2026-05-10).

## M16 — Operator polish bundle (v0.6.3 / v0.6.4) ✅

Three small, user-facing fixes. Originally planned as a single
release; split after Slice 2 landed and the user opted to ship
the data-bug fix immediately rather than wait for Slice 3.

- **Slice 1** — `chore-gitignore-tpatch-binary`: add `/tpatch` to
  `.gitignore` to ignore bare build output at the repo root. ✅
  Already in place from a prior cycle (`.gitignore:34: /tpatch`,
  rooted, anchored, `cmd/tpatch/` shadowing avoided per 2026-04-17
  incident comment). `git check-ignore -v tpatch` confirms ignore.
  No commit needed.
- **Slice 2** — `bug-record-roundtrip-false-positive-markdown`:
  fix the A3 ValidatePatchReverse false-positive. Turned out to be
  a real data bug: `gitutil.CapturePatchScoped` /
  `CapturePatchFromCommitsScoped` used `strings.TrimSpace(patch) +
  "\n"` to normalize the tail, eating semantically-significant
  trailing whitespace on the final hunk line (e.g. `+> ` markdown
  blockquote continuations). Replaced with `normalizePatchTail`
  helper that preserves content bytes. Shipped as v0.6.3. ✅
  APPROVED (commit `eba35bf` + sub-agent verdict `84cdac1`,
  external supervisor pass 2026-05-10).
- **Slice 3** — `feat-apply-default-execute` +
  `feat-skills-apply-auto-default` (unified): on inspection the
  CLI default at `internal/cli/cobra.go:586` is already `auto`
  (runs prepare→execute→done), so the simple invocation
  `tpatch apply <slug>` already does the right thing. Real work
  was doc/skill alignment: 6 skill surfaces updated so the
  recommended user-facing invocation is `tpatch apply <slug>`,
  with the four-mode ladder kept as advanced/state-machine
  fallback. New parity-guard regex anchor
  `apply-default-auto/simple-invocation` locks the contract.
  Shipped as v0.6.4. ✅ APPROVED (commit `eab2c3c` + sub-agent
  verdict `4556387`; external NEEDS REVISION on parity-anchor
  false-pass risk → revision `38d13fc` strengthened both weak
  surfaces and tightened anchor to a regex; external pass
  2026-05-10).

## M17 — boundary-capture cluster (v0.8.0) ✅ (shipped 2026-05-12 as v0.8.0; tag at `29a6732`, M17 cluster ship-stack tip at `34815e8`)

Multi-agent paper-design cluster accepted in `docs/supervisor/LOG.md` →
"Review — v0.7 Cluster PRDs (land + auto-base + collision + lock-guard) —
**2026-05-10**". Sliced into Wave A / Wave B / Wave C / Wave D mirroring
the sequencing recorded in that entry. All four waves shipped as v0.8.0
(see per-Wave ship commits below); the cluster archive lives in
`docs/handoff/HISTORY.md`.

**Shipped as v0.8.0** (supervisor decision 2026-05-10; tagged 2026-05-12).
v0.7.0 was reserved for `feat-amend-dependent-warning` — the M15 W3
freshness continuation — which landed first to keep the freshness work
contiguous. The cluster name "v0.7 cluster" is preserved in the LOG
entry's title for historical fidelity, but the implementation milestone
is v0.8.0.

- **Wave A — independent, parallel** ✅ (shipped 2026-05-11, released as part of v0.8.0)
  - **Slice A1 — `impl-record-auto-base`** ✅
    - PRD: [`docs/prds/PRD-record-auto-base.md`](prds/PRD-record-auto-base.md)
    - ADR placeholder: [ADR-016](adrs/ADR-016-record-auto-base-resolution.md)
    - Ship commits: `1d6179c` (v0) + `4484e04` (rev-1: zero-diff refusal + lock-fallback discovery)
    - Wrote shared `internal/store/upstream_lock.go` parser.
    - Follow-up captured: `m17-wave-a1-followup-ambig-discovery-diag` (Low — ambiguous discovery candidate list not surfaced when post-unusable-lock discovery fails; PRD §3.4/§3.5).
  - **Slice A2 — `impl-reconcile-lock-guard` + writer-normalization fix** ✅
    - PRD: [`docs/prds/PRD-reconcile-lock-guard.md`](prds/PRD-reconcile-lock-guard.md)
    - ADR placeholder: [ADR-017](adrs/ADR-017-reconcile-lock-guard-and-writer-normalization.md)
    - Ship commit: `8fc2e4e`
    - Bundled the HIGH-severity writer-normalization fix at `internal/workflow/reconcile.go:596-613` (`updateUpstreamLock()`) per `PRD-reconcile-lock-guard §5.3`.
    - Second parser at `internal/gitutil/lock_guard.go` due to verified `store → gitutil` import cycle (parsers line-for-line equivalent on shared keys; no drift risk). Follow-up cleanup PRD captured in CURRENT.md.
- **Wave B — depends on Wave A (auto-base)** ✅ (shipped 2026-05-11, externally approved 2026-05-12)
  - **Slice B — `impl-record-collision-detection`** ✅
    - PRD: [`docs/prds/PRD-record-collision-detection.md`](prds/PRD-record-collision-detection.md)
    - ADR: [ADR-018](adrs/ADR-018-record-collision-detection-signature.md)
    - Ship commit: `b0a434a`
    - Cross-feature canonical-patch collision detection in `tpatch
      record`; refusal exit 1 with `--allow-collision "<reason>"`
      escape hatch persisted into `record.md`. PRD §8 acceptance map:
      11/11 tests in `internal/cli/record_collision_test.go`.
- **Wave C — depends on Wave A + Wave B** ✅ (shipped 2026-05-11..14, externally approved 2026-05-12)
  - **Slice C — `impl-tpatch-land`** ✅
    - PRD: [`docs/prds/PRD-tpatch-land.md`](prds/PRD-tpatch-land.md)
    - ADRs: [ADR-019](adrs/ADR-019-tpatch-land-trailer-block-schema.md) (Accepted) + [ADR-021](adrs/ADR-021-tpatch-land-global-metadata-carve-out.md) (Accepted, rev-3)
    - Ship stack: `fb5e6ff` (core) + `73a81ed` (skill assets + parity
      guard) + `266dfb4` (ADR + CHANGELOG + handoff) + `32ad3a5`
      (rev-1: ADR ref typo + hard-parent test + `docs/land.md`) +
      `c6f4402` (rev-2: scope global metadata staging + clean tree
      on `--no-record`) + `876c584` (rev-3: PRD carve-out + ADR-021)
      + `19a335e` (rev-4: dry-run carve-out alignment + stale
      wording cleanup).
    - 5-revision history: contract sharpened from rev-0 through
      rev-4; final external supervisor verdict APPROVED end-to-end
      on rev-4.
    - New `tpatch land <slug>` flagship verb composing record →
      safe path-set staging → one Git commit, with the locked
      four-trailer block (`Tpatch-Feature`, `Tpatch-Patch-SHA`,
      `Tpatch-Recipe-SHA`, `Tpatch-Base-Commit`) + repo
      `Co-authored-by:` trailer. Documented in `docs/land.md`.
- **Wave D — independent reconcile fast-path (default-OFF)** ✅ (shipped 2026-05-11, externally approved 2026-05-12)
  - **Slice D — `impl-patch-already-upstream-detector`** ✅
    - PRD: [`docs/prds/PRD-patch-already-upstream-detector.md`](prds/PRD-patch-already-upstream-detector.md)
    - ADR: still not opened (PRD §6 keeps the feature behind
      `Config.PatchIDDetectorEnabled` default-`false` until the
      v0.8.x line decides to flip it on; ADR can be authored when
      the flag flips).
    - Ship stack: `c07e4e2` (v0) + `1d4a89f` (rev-1: phase-1.5
      reads canonical `post-apply.patch` per PRD §5.1).
    - Phase-1.5 deterministic patch-already-upstream detector
      slotted between phase 1 (reverse-apply) and phase 2
      (operation-level) in `internal/workflow/reconcile.go`,
      gated by `Config.PatchIDDetectorEnabled` (default `false`).
    - **Deferred to v0.8.1+** (called out in CHANGELOG):
      PRD §3.2 `--check-applied-only` CLI verb/flag, PRD §3.3
      `--auto-drop-merged` CLI flag, PRD §3.3 hotfix-kind
      auto-drop default gating.

## v0.7.0 — `feat-amend-dependent-warning` ✅

Continuation of the M15 W3 freshness overlay work. Shipped before M17 to
keep the freshness UX contiguous. Adds an amend-detection guard to
`record` that refuses (exit 1) when capturing a feature would orphan a
dependent's `base_commit` or `satisfied_by` SHA via a force-pushed amend,
plus a `--force-amend` escape hatch. Surfaces a `dependent-broken` label
on the affected features in `status`, `status --json`, `status --dag`,
and `status --dag --json`, with a single coalesced diagnostic line per
affected feature listing deduped abbrev SHAs and a recovery hint. New
`internal/store/dependents.go` exports `CollectDependentSHAs`,
`IsAmendBreaking`, `CollectBrokenRefs`. Reachability uses
`gitutil.IsAncestor`; amend signal derived from `HEAD@{1}^ == HEAD^`
when reflog available. Six skill surfaces updated by parity guard.

Ship commits: `8306367` (impl), `6e78eac` (rev-1), `a5e7de0` (sub-agent
verdict), tracking commit + tag `v0.7.0`. External supervisor required
one revision (DAG renderers were missing the overlay; plain-text emitted
one line per ref instead of per feature) — both addressed in `6e78eac`.

## WP-003 — Reconcile Safety and Middle-Pass Foundation ✅

Nine-PRD cluster shipping the reconcile evidence/revision schema (ADR-025)
plus middle-pass detectors, classifiers, audits, and dev-only study
validation. Governed end-to-end by ADR-025. Zero new lifecycle states.
Zero schema drift across four waves. All approved via three-way review
(internal + supervisor-external + user-external).

- **Wave α — reconcile-verdict-evidence + file-novelty** ✅ (approved 2026-05-26)
  - PRDs: [PRD-reconcile-verdict-evidence](prds/PRD-reconcile-verdict-evidence.md), [PRD-reconcile-file-novelty-classifier](prds/PRD-reconcile-file-novelty-classifier.md)
  - ADR: [ADR-025](adrs/ADR-025-reconcile-evidence-and-revision-schema.md)
  - Adds append-only `reconcile-evidence.jsonl`, `file_novelty` classifier
    (`clean-additive` / `overlap-suspect` / `unknown-novelty`), evidence
    artifact reference in status JSON + human evidence hints.

- **Wave β — confirmation-gate + revision-pass-log + hunk-overlap** ✅ (approved 2026-06-28)
  - PRDs: [PRD-upstreamed-confirmation-gate](prds/PRD-upstreamed-confirmation-gate.md), [PRD-reconcile-revision-pass-log](prds/PRD-reconcile-revision-pass-log.md), [PRD-reconcile-hunk-overlap-detector](prds/PRD-reconcile-hunk-overlap-detector.md)
  - Adds confirmation gate before `upstreamed` verdict (evidence-derived
    downgrade to `blocked` with `review_verdict=rejected-upstreamed` and
    human display `[upstreamed-candidate]`); append-only
    `reconcile-revisions.jsonl` with lenient loader + `corrupt_entries`
    JSON envelope; deterministic hunk-overlap pass after file-novelty
    with default `nearby-window=3`.

- **Wave γ-1 — retirement-audit + study-validation + blocked-taxonomy** ✅ (approved 2026-07-10)
  - PRDs: [PRD-reconcile-retirement-state-audit](prds/PRD-reconcile-retirement-state-audit.md), [PRD-reconcile-study-validation](prds/PRD-reconcile-study-validation.md), [PRD-reconcile-blocked-verdict-taxonomy](prds/PRD-reconcile-blocked-verdict-taxonomy.md)
  - Read-only `tpatch reconcile audit-retirement <slug>` + new PRD-named
    `tpatch reconcile confirm-upstreamed <slug>` trigger for auto-audit
    (Path A per γ-1 rev-1 F1). Dev-only case-study validator at
    `internal/tools/studyvalidator/` (not in public CLI, stdlib-only,
    per-corrected-verdict linkage enforcement). 8-category blocked
    taxonomy with deterministic precedence (`dependency-blocked >
    validation-blocked > target-deleted > structural-conflict >
    edit-overlap > shifted-context > clean-additive > unknown-blocked`).

- **Wave γ-2 — path-restructure-detector** ✅ (approved 2026-07-16)
  - PRD: [PRD-reconcile-path-restructure-detector](prds/PRD-reconcile-path-restructure-detector.md)
  - Detector emits `path-restructure` evidence
    (`prefix-move`/`prefix-split`/`target-deleted`/`mixed`/`none`/`unknown`)
    consumed by PRD 8 blocked-taxonomy to upgrade generic `blocked` to
    `structural-conflict` or `target-deleted`. Thresholds config-driven
    (prefix-split ≥3 files ≥2 prefixes; prefix-move ≥5 files).
    Candidate prefixes capped at 5, sorted support-desc + path-asc.
    No provider integration.

**Process artifacts**: 15 carry-forward dispatch rules codified.
Two-opinion external review protocol (supervisor + user-parallel)
caught HIGH BLOCKERs in α rev-0, β rev-0, γ-1 rev-0; confirmed fixes
in β rev-1, γ-1 rev-1, γ-2 rev-0. Full per-wave snapshots archived
to [`docs/handoff/HISTORY.md`](handoff/HISTORY.md).
