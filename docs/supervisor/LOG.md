## Review — M15-W3-DESIGN (revision pass) — 2026-04-27

**Reviewer**: Supervisor (direct, no sub-agent)
**Task**: Wave 3 design — D2 PRD/ADR alignment fix
**Commit reviewed**: `e6473ea`

### Constraint compliance
- [x] Only `docs/prds/PRD-verify-and-tested-state.md` and `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` modified
- [x] ADR-012 untouched
- [x] No Go / test / LOG.md changes
- [x] Co-author trailer present
- [x] Not pushed (supervisor pushes)

### Findings
None. PRD §3.4.4 now headlines Direction A plainly, cites ADR-012 D2 as the locking record, removes the "B-pragmatic" walk-back, and preserves Direction B as a labelled rejected alternative with its arguments intact. The "tested is a strict superset of applied" framing makes the gate semantics legible.

### Verdict: APPROVED

### Action taken
1. Archive M15-W3-DESIGN to `docs/handoff/HISTORY.md`.
2. Reset `CURRENT.md` to design-complete idle, ready for Slice A dispatch.
3. Push `fdc6e70` + `90375c9` + `e6473ea` to `origin/main`.
4. Reviewer-adjudicated open questions (Q1–Q5) are now binding inputs to Slice A's contract:
   - Q1: V9 = warn severity
   - Q2: `verify --all` skips pre-apply slugs with `"skipped: pre-apply state"` reason line
   - Q3: `passed` field name retained (severity carries gating)
   - Q4: D2 = Direction A (resolved by this revision)
   - Q5: parent-state hook inserted into existing M14.3 label-recomputation loop

### Notes
The reviewer-then-revision loop caught a real contradiction the implementer would not have surfaced solo. Single-finding reviews remain a strong sub-agent pattern: targeted, fast, auditable. The "implementer self-reviews are status-only" lesson (from v0.6.1 fix-pass) holds — neither implementer call self-flagged D2.

## Review — M15-W3-DESIGN — 2026-04-27

**Reviewer**: m15-w3-design-reviewer
**Task**: Wave 3 design — PRD + ADR-012 for feat-verify-command + feat-feature-tested-state
**Commit reviewed**: fdc6e70

### Constraint compliance
- [x] no Go code modified (only 3 docs files)
- [x] no tests modified
- [x] no ADR-011 / ADR-010 edits
- [x] no reconcile-session.json reads proposed (V9 reads status.Reconcile.Outcome only)
- [x] omitempty round-trip preserved (D4 explicit, backed by acceptance test)
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: D2 answered but **contradictory** between PRD and ADR (see below)
- [x] commit trailer present

### Findings

#### Blocking

**Issue 1: D2 PRD/ADR Contradiction — Most Consequential Decision**
**Files:** `docs/prds/PRD-verify-and-tested-state.md:263`, `docs/adrs/ADR-012-feature-tested-state.md:44`
**Severity:** Critical — blocks approval
**Problem:** PRD §3.4.4 line 263 states "DECISION (locked in ADR-012 D2): Direction B — `tested` does NOT satisfy hard dependencies." This is immediately contradicted at line 272 where "B-pragmatic" is revealed to actually mean `{applied, tested, upstream_merged}` satisfies the gate — which is Direction A. Meanwhile ADR-012 D2 line 44 states "Decided: `tested` satisfies the hard-dep gate, equivalent to `applied`" with no mention of Direction B.

The confusion stems from framing: the PRD calls Direction B "tested does not satisfy" but then implements "tested does satisfy because it's equivalent to applied" as "B-pragmatic" — which is semantically identical to Direction A. The two documents need to agree on what was decided.

**Evidence:** Cross-read PRD:263, PRD:272, ADR-012:44. The locked decision is clearly "`tested` satisfies" (the gate switch gains `case StateTested:` per ADR-012 D2 line 46), but the PRD headline at line 263 says the opposite.

**Suggested fix:** PRD §3.4.4 needs a rewrite. Either:
- Change line 263 headline to "Direction A — yes, `tested` satisfies (pragmatic equivalence)" and reframe the argument, OR
- Collapse Direction A and B-pragmatic into a single decision and remove the confusing "Direction B" framing that actually implements Direction A semantics.

ADR-012 D2 is internally consistent and correct; the PRD's presentation is the issue.

#### Non-blocking (approved with notes)

**Note 1: V9 Remediation Message Inconsistency (Open Question Q1)**
**File:** `docs/prds/PRD-verify-and-tested-state.md:473`
**Severity:** Medium — UX subtlety, not a contract bug
**Problem:** Failure case 3 JSON example shows `passed: false` on V9 with remediation text "tested cannot be promoted while reconcile is in a blocked state (warn-only)" but `verdict: passed` and `state_after: tested`. The PRD acknowledges this at line 481-483 but leaves it as an open question (Q1) rather than resolving it.

For a warn-severity check, `passed: false` is semantically correct (the check condition failed), but the field name may mislead operators into thinking promotion was blocked. The PRD's Q1 framing is appropriate, but the implementer will face the same ambiguity when coding Slice A.

**Recommendation:** Settle Q1 now rather than deferring to implementation. See Open Question Recommendations below.

**Note 2: Parent-State Hook Performance — No Hot-Path Added**
**File:** `docs/prds/PRD-verify-and-tested-state.md:301`, `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md:126`
**Severity:** Low — clarification request
**Problem:** PRD §3.4.5 line 301 states "no new hot path" for the parent-state hook, and Open Question Q5 asks the reviewer to confirm. The hook runs in the same `LoadFeatureStatus` loop as M14.3 label recomputation (per PRD), which is already O(V+E). The additional check (parent left `{applied, tested, upstream_merged}` AND child currently `tested`) is a constant-time state comparison per edge.

**Assessment:** The performance claim is sound. The hook is cheap and correctly inserted. No concern.

**Note 3: V6 Warn-Only Severity — Justified but Nuanced**
**File:** `docs/prds/PRD-verify-and-tested-state.md:173-180`
**Severity:** Low — design choice documented
**Problem:** V6 (`dependency_gate_satisfied`) is warn-only, meaning a feature whose hard parent is `defined` can still promote to `tested`. PRD §3.3 justifies this for pre-apply harness handoff and `upstream_merged` parent scenarios. The reviewer-relevant counter-argument is recorded as rejected in D2 alt 3.

**Assessment:** The decision is internally consistent with D2's pragmatic equivalence (tested parents satisfy, so children of tested parents are structurally fine even if the gate check produces a warn). The PRD's justification holds. No change required, but implementers should be aware this is a design choice, not an oversight.

### Open-question recommendations

**Q1 — V9 severity: warn vs block**
**Recommendation:** Keep **warn** (the PRD default). Reasoning: `shadow-awaiting` is not a structural integrity problem — it's a pending human decision. A feature sitting in `shadow-awaiting` can be perfectly healthy on disk; blocking `tested` on V9 would penalize the harness for the operator not having clicked "accept" yet. If a real need surfaces for "tested implies no pending reconcile work," revisit in a future `feat-tested-stronger-contract` PRD.

**Q2 — `verify --all` skip semantics**
**Recommendation:** Skip pre-apply states with a `"skipped: pre-apply state"` line (the PRD default). `tested` is meaningless before `applied`. Exit code reflects only post-apply slugs. Slice D detail; document in the `--all` help text.

**Q3 — `passed: false` field name on warn-only checks**
**Recommendation:** Keep `passed` as the field name. Rename would require touching every check's JSON shape, and "passed" is semantically accurate (the check condition was evaluated; it did not pass). The `severity` field carries the gating semantics. If this proves confusing in practice, revisit in a UX polish pass. For Slice A, ship as designed.

**Q4 — D2 wording check**
**Recommendation:** **Fix the PRD.** The current PRD headline "Direction B — tested does NOT satisfy" followed by "but actually it does" is confusing. ADR-012 D2 is clear and correct. Rewrite PRD §3.4.4 lines 242-277 to match the ADR's framing: "Direction A — tested satisfies because it's a strict superset of applied." Remove the "B-pragmatic" terminology entirely — it's a semantic no-op over Direction A.

**Q5 — Parent-state hook insertion point**
**Recommendation:** Approved as designed. The `LoadFeatureStatus` post-processing loop (same site as M14.3 label recomputation) is the correct insertion point. The additional check is cheap (constant-time per edge). No new hot path. Implementer can proceed with Slice B as specified.

### Verdict: **NEEDS REVISION**

**Blocking issue:** D2 PRD/ADR contradiction must be resolved before any implementation slice begins. The locked decision is clear in ADR-012 ("tested satisfies"); the PRD's presentation contradicts itself. Fix required: rewrite PRD §3.4.4 to align with ADR-012 D2, removing the "Direction B" headline that actually implements Direction A.

**Non-blocking notes:** V9 warn-severity UX subtlety (Q1) and V6 warn-only justification are documented design choices, not bugs. Parent-state hook performance is sound.

**Open questions:** All 5 adjudicated above. Q4 (D2 wording) is a blocker-fix requirement; the others are confirmations of the PRD defaults.

### Notes

**For supervisor:**
- Once D2 PRD rewrite lands, this design is ready for Slice A dispatch.
- The PRD is otherwise thorough: 678 lines covering 10 checks with primitive citations, full state-transition table, 4 implementation slices with clear boundaries, 3 JSON failure-case examples, backwards-compat contract with acceptance-test enforcement, and explicit out-of-scope cross-links.
- ADR-012 is well-structured: 201 lines, 7 decisions locked with alternatives considered, full cross-references to ADR-010/ADR-011, and correct preservation of the source-truth guard.
- No contract conflicts found with ADR-011 (dep DAG), ADR-010 (resolver), or the v0.6.1 satisfied_by contract beyond the D2 presentation issue.
- Implementation slices are independently dispatchable and correctly scoped.

**For implementer (post-fix):**
- D2 is "tested satisfies the hard-dep gate" (extend `CheckDependencyGate` switch). Ignore the PRD's "Direction B" headline; read ADR-012 D2 as the source of truth until the PRD is fixed.
- V9 reads `status.Reconcile.Outcome` only — never `artifacts/reconcile-session.json`. The adversarial test in §7 is mandatory.
- The omitempty round-trip fixture `TestUpgradeFromV0_6_1_NoVerify_BehavesIdentically` is mandatory for Slice B.
- Skill parity guard extension (6 surfaces) is mandatory for Slice D.

## Supervisor Fix-Pass — M15-W2 Re-Review — 2026-04-27

**Author**: supervisor (re-review by external reviewer)
**Scope**: 4 medium findings against the M15-W1 + M15-W2 surface that landed at `ad040ac`.
**Disposition**: All 4 fixed in the same pass; no Wave 3 dispatch.

### Findings (re-reviewer)

1. **Medium — F1 satisfied_by contract drift.** Validation accepted any reachable ref (including unique short SHAs); apply-time gate still rejected anything not 40-hex. Save-now/fail-later dependency path. *Anchors:* `internal/store/validation.go:82`, `internal/store/validation_test.go:161`, `internal/workflow/dependency_gate.go:83`.
2. **Medium — F2 scoped record metadata leak.** `record --files` scoped the patch but `CaptureDiffStat` was unscoped, so `post-apply-diff.txt` and `record.md` still embedded full-tree diffstat (cross-feature pollution). *Anchors:* `internal/cli/cobra.go:865/867/872`, `internal/gitutil/gitutil.go:181`.
3. **Medium — F3 invalid pathspec swallowed.** `CapturePatchScoped` replaced any git-diff error with empty output, then `recordCmd` reported the generic "captured 0 bytes" diagnostic. *Anchors:* `internal/gitutil/gitutil.go:244/246`, `internal/cli/cobra.go:810/824`.
4. **Medium — F4 Windows syntax-check quoting.** `UserShell` returns `cmd /C` on Windows, but `shellQuote` always emitted POSIX single-quote form, leaking quote characters into argv. *Anchors:* `internal/workflow/validation.go:169/239`, `internal/workflow/shell.go:13`.

### Fixes

- **F1**: tightened validation to require 40-hex SHA *and* reachability — same value space as the apply-time gate. New sentinel `ErrSatisfiedByMalformed`. Added `TestValidateDependencies_SatisfiedByMalformed`. Existing reachability/git-error tests rebased onto 40-hex literals so they cover the post-fix code path.
- **F2**: new `CaptureDiffStatScoped(repoRoot, pathspecs)` in `internal/gitutil`; `CaptureDiffStat` now delegates with `nil` (byte-identical default behavior). `recordCmd` calls the scoped variant so artifacts narrow with `--files`.
- **F3**: `CapturePatchScoped` now propagates the git-diff error when pathspecs is non-empty, wrapping with the rejected pathspecs for diagnostics. Empty pathspecs preserves the historical tolerant behavior the unscoped capture path has always relied on.
- **F4**: `shellQuote` is now `shellQuoteFor(goos, p)`; Windows uses double-quote/double-quote-escape (cmd.exe convention), Unix retains single-quote form. New `TestShellQuoteFor` and a pairing invariant test (`TestShellQuoteFor_PairsWithUserShell`) lock the contract to the OS the runtime actually picks.

### Validation gate

- `gofmt -l .` clean.
- `go build ./cmd/tpatch` clean.
- `go test ./...` clean (all 7 packages).
- Focused: `go test ./internal/store -run Validate` — 17 cases, all pass; new malformed coverage included.

### Notes

- Apply-gate was deliberately left as-is (`internal/workflow/dependency_gate.go:83` regex check). The contract is now: validation does both (40-hex + reachability), apply does the cheaper well-formed check as defense-in-depth. ADR-011 D5 unchanged; the gate's documented limitation (no reachability at apply-time) is now backed by validation refusing to persist anything reachability would reject.
- Patch authority invariant preserved (ADR-011 D6, post-apply.patch is reconcile source-of-truth).
- Skill parity guard passes; recipe-op JSON schema untouched; `delete-file` op still deferred.

### Action

Findings closed in-tree before tagging `v0.6.1`. Handoff transitions: CURRENT.md → fix-pass complete, awaiting tag/Wave 3 decision.

## Review — M15-W2 — 2026-04-26

**Reviewer**: m15-w2-reviewer (code-review)
**Task**: Wave 2 — bug-test-command-shell-selection + feat-record-autogen-recipe + bug-recipe-stale-after-manual-flow + feat-record-scoped-files
**Diff range**: `827239b..2c5ae33`

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Formatted
- [x] Parity guard green
- [x] Recipe-op JSON schema unchanged
- [x] Source-truth guard preserved (ADR-011 D6)
- [x] Patch remains reconcile authority (no recipe inversion)
- [x] Unix shell behavior byte-identical
- [x] No silent schema extension for delete-file
- [x] Stale-recipe default is non-destructive
- [x] Pathspec passed safely (-- separator)

### Verdict: APPROVED

### Findings

None — all 4 items meet contract; 5 design judgment calls verified.

**JC1 — Schema gap handling**: `RecipeFromPatch` (recipe_autogen.go:86-121) correctly skips deleted files at lines 100-102 with reason "deleted — recipe schema has no delete-file op". Warnings surface on stderr at cobra.go:917-919. No new op type added to RecipeOperation schema. ✅

**JC2 — Stale recipe sidecar policy**: Default behavior non-destructive (line 182-199 of recipe_autogen.go writes sidecar, never overwrites recipe unless `regenerate=true`). `--regenerate-recipe` actually regenerates (line 183-188). Sidecar JSON carries stale flag, reason, timestamp (RecipeStaleness struct, lines 27-31). Warning surfaces clearly on stderr (cobra.go:908-913). All scenarios tested (recipe_autogen_test.go). ✅

**JC3 — Drift detection scope**: File-set comparison only, confirmed at recipe_autogen.go:211-239 (`compareRecipeFileSets` checks path set membership, not content hashes). Documented in code comments (line 145-148). No new code reads `apply-recipe.json` for reconcile authority — grep confirms patch remains source of truth. ✅

**JC4 — `--files` + `--from` mutual exclusion**: Explicit error at cobra.go:862-863 with actionable message. Error fires before side effects (before CapturePatch call). Unit test coverage at cobra_test.go:864-882. ✅

**JC5 — Hookable shell selection**: `userShellFor(goos)` at shell.go:19-24 produces byte-identical Unix behavior (`sh`, `-c` — not `bash`, not `/bin/sh`, no path substitution). Windows path is `cmd`, `/C`. Tests cover both branches via goos injection (shell_test.go). All three call sites updated (validation.go, phase2.go per git diff). ✅

### Action Taken

Verdict logged. Supervisor decides closeout, v0.6.1 cut, and Wave 3 dispatch pause.

## Review — M15-W1 — 2026-04-26

**Reviewer**: m15-w1-reviewer (code-review)
**Task**: Wave 1 — feat-satisfied-by-reachability + chore-skill-frontmatter + feat-define-spec-alias
**Diff range**: `1736c4d..192935b`

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles (go build ./cmd/tpatch)
- [x] Tests pass (go test ./...)
- [x] Formatted (gofmt -l .)
- [x] Parity guard green
- [x] Source-truth guard (ADR-011 D6) preserved
- [x] No new parity anchor for the spec alias
- [x] Frontmatter doesn't break loader expectations
- [x] Reachability check gated correctly (no double-fail)

### Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES

### Findings

- **Medium** / `internal/store/validation_test.go` — Missing test coverage for git error path (when isAncestor returns non-nil error). The implementer flagged this as judgment call #2 requiring explicit verification: "Bogus refs surface as wrapped errors, not as silent `ErrSatisfiedBySHANotReachable`." The `TestIsAncestor` in `gitutil_test.go` covers the git-level error case, but there's no validation-level test that exercises `stubIsAncestor(t, false, errors.New("git failure"))` to verify the wrapped error includes the dependent slug and doesn't silently ignore git failures. Current tests only stub `(true, nil)`, `(false, nil)`. **Fix**: Add `TestValidateDependencies_SatisfiedByGitError` that stubs `isAncestor` to return `(false, fmt.Errorf("bad ref"))` and asserts the validation error wraps it with the expected "verify satisfied_by reachability for <slug> -> <parent>" prefix.

All other flagged items verified:
1. **Double-fail avoidance**: Both `ValidateDependencies` (L76-90) and `ValidateAllFeatures` (L144-154) gate reachability check on `parent.State == StateUpstreamMerged`, so `ErrSatisfiedByRequiresUpstream` fires alone when parent is not upstream_merged. ✅
2. **IsAncestor exit semantics**: Correctly implemented at `gitutil.go:633-650`. Exit 0 → `(true, nil)`, exit 1 → `(false, nil)`, other → `(false, wrapped error with stderr)`. Error wrapping includes ancestor/descendant in message. ✅
3. **Real-git test coverage**: `TestIsAncestor` (gitutil_test.go:210-255) exercises all three paths: reachable (L244), unreachable (L248), bogus-ref error (L252). Uses real git repo, not stubs. ✅

### Action Taken
Verdict logged. Supervisor decides closeout / Wave 2 dispatch.

### Verdict: APPROVED

M15.1 is correct and complete. The implementation precisely matches the PRD §4.3.1 algorithm spec: replace-in-file ops with empty created_by and non-empty Search trigger a scan of HARD parents only (soft parents skipped per ADR-011 D4); when exactly one hard parent's post-apply.patch contains the Search bytes AND pristine working tree does not, an advisory suggestion is emitted to stderr. Multiple matches produce an ambiguity warning with no specific suggestion. Zero matches are silent (apply-time gate remains the authoritative enforcement point).

The advisory-only contract is strictly honored: the recipe is never mutated (deep-copy tests verify), operator authority is preserved, and suggestions are written to stderr for manual review. The opt-out flag (`--no-created-by-infer`) and flag-off guard (`features_dependencies: false`) both produce byte-identical pre-v0.6 behavior.

Scope guards all satisfied: created_by_gate.go untouched, no write-file ops processed, no transitive scanning, no new external deps, version stays at 0.6.0, CHANGELOG untouched. All 8 tests are meaningful (real fixtures, observable behavior asserts, covers all branches). Implementer's degradation-to-warning note verified: transient read errors don't block recipe persistence.

Full test suite green (all M14 series tests + new inference tests pass). Code quality high: clear comments, correct error handling, deterministic output (sorted parent matches), efficient fast-paths (candidate collection, cached parent patches, pristine short-circuit).

Ready to archive handoff. Supervisor can decide on v0.6.1 cut timing.

### Notes

None — clean implementation with no issues found.

### Checklist

**Chunk A — `status --dag` ✅**
- [x] Uses `--json` flag, NOT `--format json` (correct flag name at cobra.go:196, status_dag.go:92)
- [x] Hard deps render `─►`, soft render `┄►` (status_dag.go:316-318)
- [x] Reads from `status.Reconcile.Outcome` via `EffectiveOutcome()`, never `reconcile-session.json` (status_dag.go:5 comment confirms ADR-010 D5 compliance, line 328 uses `st.Reconcile.EffectiveOutcome()`)
- [x] Cycle-safe: uses `DetectCycles`, visited-set prevents infinite recursion (status_dag.go:89, walkTree line 289-293)
- [x] Scoped and full DAG modes (scopeSet at line 90, scoped param honored throughout)
- [x] JSON schema deterministic and stable (dagJSONPayload struct lines 58-65, sorted roots/features)
- [x] Tests cover all scenarios: 7 tests in status_dag_test.go including cycle, empty, scoped, labels, JSON

**Chunk B — flag flip ✅**
- [x] Default now true in parseYAMLConfig (store.go:544 `cfg.FeaturesDependencies = true`)
- [x] Init template writes explicit true (store.go:88)
- [x] Byte-identity tests updated: dependency_gate_apply_test.go opts out (line 66 `features_dependencies: false`), accept_labels_test.go opts out (line 106)
- [x] Roundtrip test inverted: TestConfig_FeaturesDependenciesRoundtrip (roundtrip_test.go) tests default-true + explicit-false

**Chunk C — dep-management CLI ✅**
- [x] All verbs present: `feature deps` read/add/remove/validate-all at feature_deps.go:50-95
- [x] `amend --depends-on/--remove-depends-on` present (c1.go:48, feature_deps.go:274-290)
- [x] `remove --cascade` present with ErrInteractiveRequired for non-TTY (feature_deps.go:308-367)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: `--force` alone does NOT bypass DAG integrity (c1.go:231-238 comment + code: cascade gate enforced regardless of force flag)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Test confirms force-bypass prevention: TestRemoveForce_DoesNotBypassDepCheck at feature_deps_test.go asserts exit code != 0 when force used without cascade
- [x] Add operations validate cycles/parent existence/no self-ref/no kind conflict (routed through store.ValidateDependencies)
- [x] Remove operations re-derive dependents atomically (store maintains dependents graph)
- [x] Cascade removes in reverse-topological order (feature_deps.go:319-340, leaves-first via reversed Kahn order)
- [x] All 9 tests present and meaningful: TestFeatureDeps_Show_NoDeps, TestFeatureDepsAdd_RejectsCycle, TestFeatureDepsAdd_RejectsKindConflict, TestFeatureDepsRemove_ClearsAtomically, TestAmendDependsOn_ValidatedIdenticallyToFeatureDeps, TestRemoveWithCascade_DeletesInReverseTopoOrder, TestRemoveWithoutCascade_RefusesWhenDependentsExist, TestRemoveForce_DoesNotBypassDepCheck, TestRemoveCascadeNonTTY_RequiresForce, TestFeatureDepsValidateAll_OnInit

**Chunk D — status-time validation ✅**
- [x] `tpatch status` revalidates DAG and surfaces warnings (cobra.go:204-215)

**Chunk E — 6-skill rollout ✅**
- [x] All 6 skill files updated: claude/tessera-patch/SKILL.md, copilot/tessera-patch/SKILL.md, copilot prompt (tessera-patch-apply.prompt.md), cursor/tessera-patch.mdc, windsurf/windsurfrules, generic workflow (tessera-patch-generic.md) — all contain "Feature dependencies" section + created_by gate description
- [x] Each covers: dependencies field, label reference, compound verdict, created_by gate (not inert), status --dag, feature deps verbs, amend --depends-on, remove --cascade, force ≠ bypass rule
- [x] Parity guard passes: `go test ./assets/... -count=1` green (confirmed)
- [x] created_by reframed from "inert" to live gate (e.g., SKILL.md:160 states "live apply-time gate")

**Chunk F — docs/dependencies.md ✅**

- [x] Version bumped to 0.6.0 (cobra.go:24)
- [x] CHANGELOG.md has new v0.6.0 section (lines 5-34, dated 2026-04-26)
- [x] ROADMAP.md M14 marked ✅ (line 175, M14.4 expanded with chunk breakdown)
- [x] NOT tagged (git tag -l v0.6.0 returns empty — tagging is supervisor's job)

**Cross-cutting / scope guards ✅**
- [x] No new external Go dependencies (only cobra/pflag + stdlib)
- [x] No ReconcileWaitingOnParent/ReconcileBlockedByParent enum values (labels remain composable, not states)
- [x] No parent-patch injection into M12 resolver (per ADR-011 D8, deferred)
- [x] No implement-phase `created_by` heuristic inference (per PRD §4.3.1, separate backlog)
- [x] All commits carry Co-authored-by trailer (7 instances confirmed)

- [x] Store tests (Dependency, Roundtrip) — 8 tests pass (0.403s)

### Verdict: APPROVED

### Notes

This is a clean, comprehensive release cutover. All 7 chunks land exactly as specified in the handoff contract. The critical correctness checks all pass:

1. **Chunk A** correctly uses `--json` flag (not `--format json` per prior reviewer finding), renders hard/soft edges with correct glyphs, reads from status-of-record via `EffectiveOutcome()`, and handles cycles safely.

2. **Chunk B** default flip is correctly implemented in parseYAMLConfig with true when absent, tests properly updated to opt out where needed for byte-identity preservation.

3. **Chunk C** correctly enforces the `--force ≠ bypass` rule (PRD §3.7, ADR-011 D7) — the remove command checks dependents BEFORE evaluating force flag, and TestRemoveForce_DoesNotBypassDepCheck explicitly validates this behavior. Cascade removes in reverse-topological order as required.

4. **Chunk D** status-time validation surfaces dangling deps and cycles inline, with dedicated tests for both scenarios.

5. **Chunk E** 6-skill rollout is complete with parity guard passing, `created_by` correctly reframed from "inert" to "live apply-time gate" across all formats.

6. **Chunk F** comprehensive user documentation (docs/dependencies.md) covers all required topics including the dry-run downgrade for `created_by` gate (matching PRD §4.3).

7. **Chunk G** release mechanics correct: version bumped, CHANGELOG complete with M14.1–M14.4 summary, ROADMAP updated, no premature tag.

**No blocking issues found.** All scope guards honored, no drift from ADR-011 decisions, test coverage comprehensive, working tree clean. Ready for supervisor tag `v0.6.0` and milestone closeout.

### Critical correctness checks (all 15 pass)

**F1 (HIGH, cutover-blocking) — `created_by` apply-time gate**

1. ✅ **Hard parent + missing target** — `TestCreatedByGate_HardParent_TargetMissing_ErrPathCreatedByParent` verifies both dry-run and execute paths return `ErrPathCreatedByParent` (sentinel, errors.Is-friendly). Error message includes target path, parent slug, and "apply parent first" guidance. Gate implemented at recipe.go:96 (dryRunOperation replace-in-file), line 113 (append-file), line 149 (executeOperation replace-in-file), line 166 (append-file). Four call sites, all correct.

2. ✅ **Soft parent fall-through** — `TestCreatedByGate_SoftParent_TargetMissing_FallsThroughWithWarning` verifies warning emitted to `WarnWriter` (captureWarn test helper confirms it's observable, not silently logged). Gate returns nil → falls through to existing not-found error. Warning text: `"note: op declares created_by=%s; soft deps do not gate apply\n"`. ADR-011 D4 compliant (soft deps never gate apply).

3. ✅ **created_by not in depends_on** — `TestCreatedByGate_ParentNotInDependsOn_RecipeRejected` verifies recipe-shape validation at dry-run time. Error message: `"recipe op declares created_by=%s but %s is not in depends_on"`. Validation error (distinct from ErrPathCreatedByParent).

4. ✅ **Target exists** — `TestCreatedByGate_HardParent_TargetExists_NoError` verifies gate passes when file is present. ExecuteRecipe succeeds, replacement applied. No false positives.

5. ✅ **upstream_merged satisfies** — `TestCreatedByGate_ParentUpstreamMerged_TargetExists_NoError` verifies parent in `StateUpstreamMerged` + target present → gate passes. ADR-011 D5 contract met (upstreamed parent satisfies hard deps). Gate doesn't inspect parent state directly (delegates to target-exists check).

6. ✅ **Flag-off byte-identity** — `TestCreatedByGate_FlagOff_NoOp` verifies with `features_dependencies: false` (default), `CreatedBy` is inert. Missing target surfaces bare "file not found" error (v0.5.3 behavior). No ErrPathCreatedByParent, no guidance leak. Early return at created_by_gate.go:65-68 when `!cfg.DAGEnabled()`.

7. ✅ **Op-type scope** — `TestCreatedByGate_AppliesToReplaceAndAppend` verifies gate fires for `replace-in-file` and `append-file` only. `write-file` and `ensure-directory` do NOT call `checkCreatedByGate` (verified in recipe.go:83-87, 121-125, 140-144, 177-178). Gate fires when target-must-exist precondition applies; creation ops bypass it. ADR-011 D4 narrow scope respected.

**F2 (MEDIUM) — Label/AttemptedAt consistency**

8. ✅ **Shared timestamp threading** — `TestRunReconcile_ClearsStaleLabel_WhenChildRefreshed` verifies single `attemptedAt` timestamp generated once in `saveReconcileArtifacts` (reconcile.go:468-470), reused by `updateFeatureState` (line 525-527). `composeLabelsAt` (labels.go:111-126) uses same timestamp as staleness baseline. Persisted `Labels` reflect the `AttemptedAt` about to be written (not the OLD on-disk value). No child flagged stale against itself. Unexported field (line 54) invisible to encoding/json — no schema impact, no fixture drift. Test loads pre-stale fixture, runs reconcile, asserts `stale-parent-applied` cleared.

9. ✅ **Other labels preserved** — `TestRunReconcile_PreservesOtherLabels_WhenStaleResolved` verifies selective clearing. Two parents: `p-stale` (applied, old UpdatedAt → stale clears) and `p-pending` (analyzed → waiting-on-parent remains). After reconcile, `Labels` contains only `[waiting-on-parent]` (stale gone, waiting preserved). Label set is recomputed via `composeLabelsFromStatus`, not flushed wholesale.

**F3 (MEDIUM) — Upstreamed children suppress parent labels**

10. ✅ **Upstreamed suppression** — `TestComposeLabels_UpstreamedChild_NoLabels` verifies child with `Reconcile.Outcome == ReconcileUpstreamed` returns nil labels (early return at labels.go:144-147). Parent in `StateBlocked` would normally produce `blocked-by-parent`, but suppression fires first. `childRetiredOutcomes` set (line 135-137) currently contains only `ReconcileUpstreamed` (ADR-011: once absorbed upstream, parent context is irrelevant).

11. ✅ **Non-suppressed outcomes still produce labels** — `TestComposeLabels_NonSuppressedOutcome_StillProducesLabels` verifies child with `ReconcileReapplied` (not in retired set) + stale parent → `stale-parent-applied` label emitted. Suppression is narrowly scoped. Other terminal outcomes (`Blocked`, `BlockedRequiresHuman`, `ShadowAwaiting`, etc.) remain live — labels still compose.

**Scope & hygiene**

12. ✅ **No scope creep** — No version bump in `internal/cli/cobra.go` (`version = "0.5.3"` unchanged). No `CHANGELOG.md` modification (`git diff 6d95593..HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md` empty). No `internal/store/types.go` changes (`git diff 6d95593..HEAD -- internal/store/types.go` empty) — no new `ReconcileOutcome` enum values added. No skill format updates (`git diff 6d95593..HEAD -- assets/skills/` empty). No external Go deps (only `github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch/internal/store` imported). No `--dag` command, no `--force` bypass, no implement-phase heuristic inference of `created_by`. Strict scope respected.

13. ✅ **No reconcile-session.json reads in new code** — `grep -rn "reconcile-session.json" internal/workflow/created_by_gate.go internal/workflow/labels.go` returns only comments (line 13-14 in labels.go as AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE GUARD, line 25 in created_by_gate.go stating "does NOT consult any reconcile-session or apply-session artifact"). No new reads added. M14.3 external-reviewer guard preserved.

14. ✅ **Regression** — M14.1/M14.2/M14.3 tests: `TestComposeLabels_ReadsStatusJsonNotSessionArtifact` PASS (adversarial guard, labels.go reads status.json only). `TestReconcile_FlagOn_BlockedByParent_SkipsPhase35` PASS (phase-3.5 skip logic unchanged). `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` PASS (golden fixture regression). `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow` PASS (shadow accept flow). Full suite: `go test ./...` → all packages ok.

15. ✅ **Hygiene** — `gofmt -l .` clean. `go build ./cmd/tpatch` succeeds. No `tpatch` binary at root (`ls -la tpatch` → does not exist). 4 commits, 4 `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailers (verified via `git log --format='%B' 6d95593..HEAD | grep -c "Co-authored-by"`). Working tree clean (`git status --short` empty).

### Implementation notes

**F1 architecture**: `checkCreatedByGate` signature is `(s *store.Store, childSlug string, op RecipeOperation, targetExists bool)`. Caller passes `targetExists` to avoid double-stat. Gate early-returns when `op.CreatedBy == ""` (line 58) or `!cfg.DAGEnabled()` (line 65-68) — lazy store access preserves flag-off byte-identity. Hard/soft classification via child's `depends_on` (loaded at line 69). Soft-parent branch (line 107-112) emits warning via `fmt.Fprintf(WarnWriter, ...)`, then returns nil (caller proceeds to not-found error). Sentinel `ErrPathCreatedByParent` (line 43) is `errors.New`, wrapped via `fmt.Errorf("%w: ...", ErrPathCreatedByParent, ...)` for `errors.Is` compatibility.

**F2 architecture**: `attemptedAt` field added to `ReconcileResult` (reconcile.go:54), unexported. Populated lazily (whichever helper runs first generates it, the other reuses). `composeLabelsAt(s, slug, asOf)` helper (labels.go:111-126) accepts explicit timestamp, temporarily overwrites `child.Reconcile.AttemptedAt` before delegating to `composeLabelsFromStatus` (line 125). `ComposeLabels` refactored to delegate to `composeLabelsFromStatus(s, child)` (line 102) so callers can override fields without disk round-trip. Public `ComposeLabels` signature unchanged (backward-compatible).

**F3 architecture**: `childRetiredOutcomes` map (labels.go:135-137) checked first in `composeLabelsFromStatus` (line 144). Early return nil when child retired. Map-based for O(1) lookup + extensibility (future `ReconcileObsolete` or similar can slot in). Comment at line 133-134 lists the live outcomes explicitly (Reapplied, StillNeeded, Blocked, ShadowAwaiting, BlockedTooManyConflicts, BlockedRequiresHuman) — those outcomes keep the child live, labels continue to compose.

**Call-site updates**: `DryRunRecipe` and `ExecuteRecipe` signatures changed from `(repoRoot string, recipe ApplyRecipe)` to `(s *store.Store, recipe ApplyRecipe)` (recipe.go:29, 48). Three call sites updated: `internal/cli/cobra.go` lines 466 + 552, `internal/cli/phase2.go` line 136. All pass `s` instead of `s.Root`. `slug` read from `recipe.Feature` (recipe.go:75 in `dryRunOperation`, line 132 in `executeOperation`).

**Test coverage**: 7 F1 tests (gate correctness + flag-off + op-type scope), 2 F2 tests (stale clears + other labels preserved), 2 F3 tests (upstreamed suppresses + non-suppressed still produce). All 11 tests in new files (`created_by_gate_test.go`, `labels_freshness_test.go`, `labels_upstreamed_test.go`). No existing tests modified. M14.1/M14.2/M14.3 regression suite green (24 tests from prior milestones).

**Documentation**: `created_by_gate.go` header comments (lines 1-25) cite PRD §4.3 contract as authoritative. `labels.go` header AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE GUARD (lines 9-16) explicitly forbids reconcile-session reads. `reconcile.go` field comment (lines 44-54) explains timestamp-threading rationale. CURRENT.md session summary complete (lines 140-214), files changed list accurate.

### Verdict

**APPROVED**

All 15 critical checks pass. F1 contract is correctly wired in both dry-run and execute paths, with flag-off byte-identity, op-type scope, and sentinel error. F2 timestamp threading is sound (one shared `attemptedAt`, no stale-against-self). F3 suppression is narrowly scoped (only `ReconcileUpstreamed` retired). No scope creep, no regressions, hygiene clean. Test coverage is comprehensive (7+2+2 = 11 new tests, all M14.1/M14.2/M14.3 tripwires green).

Ready for M14.4 cutover (flag flip, skill rollout, `tpatch status --dag`, v0.6.0 tag) on user green-light.

## Review — C5 fix-pass — 2026-04-26

**Implementer**: c5-implementer sub-agent (general-purpose, elapsed unknown)
**Reviewer**: code-review sub-agent (this review)
**Task**: C5 fix-pass — two re-reviewer findings on M14 correctness pass. F1 (HIGH): reconcile-time label suppression incomplete. F2 (MEDIUM): PRD §4.3 dry-run downgrade not implemented. ~140 LOC across 5 files, flag-protected.

### Commits reviewed (delta vs correctness pass closeout `eb4f4f1`)

- `c84c7a6` fix(workflow): suppress labels in reconcile-time upstreamed path (C5 F1)
- `dd72c2c` fix(workflow): downgrade created_by to warning in dry-run (C5 F2)
- `ea94fb7` docs(handoff): C5 fix-pass complete, ready for review

### Checklist

- [x] Builds, tests, gofmt all green
- [x] 4 new F1 tests (phase-1/2/3 upstreamed + non-upstreamed control)
- [x] F2 tests split (dry-run-downgrades + execute-errors as separate cases)
- [x] M14.1+M14.2+M14.3+correctness-pass regression clean
- [x] All 3 commits carry the Co-authored-by trailer
- [x] CURRENT.md accurate (Status: C5 fix-pass ✅ COMPLETE — awaiting reviewer)
- [x] Working tree clean, no tpatch binary

### Critical correctness checks — F1 (reconcile-path label suppression)

1. **Phase-1 reverse-apply** ✅ — `TestRunReconcile_Phase1ReverseApply_UpstreamedClearsLabels` seeds child with OLD `ReconcileBlocked` + persisted `waiting-on-parent` label, parent in `StateAnalyzed` (would normally re-fire label), simulates `result.Outcome = ReconcileUpstreamed` from phase-1, asserts BOTH `status.json` AND `reconcile-session.json` have empty/nil Labels. JSON must not contain `"labels"` key (omitempty defense-in-depth check at line 79 of test). PASS.

2. **Phase-2 op-level** ✅ — `TestRunReconcile_Phase2OperationLevel_UpstreamedClearsLabels` same setup, same assertions, `result.Phase = "phase-2-operation-level"`. PASS.

3. **Phase-3 provider-semantic** ✅ — `TestRunReconcile_Phase3ProviderSemantic_UpstreamedClearsLabels` same pattern, `result.Phase = "phase-3-provider-semantic"`. PASS.

4. **Non-upstreamed control** ✅ — `TestRunReconcile_NonUpstreamedOutcome_StillProducesLabels` uses `ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman` outcome (not retired), asserts `hasLabel(got.Reconcile.Labels, store.LabelWaitingOnParent)` is true. Guards against over-broad fix that would suppress all labels. PASS.

5. **`updateFeatureState` audit** ✅ — Does NOT independently compose labels. At reconcile.go:523 (inside `updateFeatureState`), it writes `Labels: result.Labels` — propagates the in-memory value from `saveReconcileArtifacts`. No second composition path exists. The C5 F1 guard in `saveReconcileArtifacts` (lines 488-489) forces `result.Labels = nil` for retired outcomes BEFORE `updateFeatureState` sees it, so both status.json and reconcile-session.json get the same nil value.

6. **Pre-existing labels wiped** ✅ — The `seedRetiredChildScaffolding` test helper (labels_reconcile_path_test.go:32-49) explicitly seeds `child.Reconcile.Labels = []store.ReconcileLabel{store.LabelWaitingOnParent}` in the on-disk status before reconcile. All 3 phase tests assert post-reconcile Labels are empty (not "preserved the old label"). Retired child gets a clean slate.

7. **Adversarial guard preserved** ✅ — `TestComposeLabels_ReadsStatusJsonNotSessionArtifact` (from M14.3 tripwire set) still passes. The new C5 code path in `saveReconcileArtifacts` short-circuits BEFORE calling `composeLabelsAt`, so it never touches the session artifact at all. Guard confirmed: grep of reconcile.go shows only WRITES to reconcile-session.json (lines 40, 447, 450, 472, 497, 499), zero reads.

### Critical correctness checks — F2 (dry-run downgrade)

8. **Dry-run hard parent + missing target** ✅ — `TestCreatedByGate_DryRun_HardParent_TargetMissing_DowngradesToWarning` (created_by_gate_test.go:111-142) asserts `res.Success == true` (no error), `res.Applied == 1` (op counted as deferred-applied), `len(res.Warnings) == 1`, warning contains `["src/auth.ts", "parent", "apply parent before executing"]`. Recipe-level test confirms both replace-in-file and append-file op types downgrade. PASS.

9. **Execute hard parent + missing target** ✅ — `TestCreatedByGate_Execute_HardParent_TargetMissing_ReturnsErr` (lines 147-160) asserts `res.Success == false`, `len(res.Errors) == 1`, error contains `"will be created by parent feature parent"`. No regression from correctness pass. PASS.

10. **Soft parent missing target** ✅ — `TestCreatedByGate_SoftParent_TargetMissing_FallsThroughWithWarning` (lines 188-217) asserts `res.Success == false` (bare not-found error), `!errors.Is(errors.New(res.Errors[0]), ErrPathCreatedByParent)`, `WarnWriter` captured text contains `["soft-parent", "soft deps do not gate apply"]`. Dry-run and execute behavior unchanged from correctness pass. PASS.

11. **Recipe-shape validation** ✅ — `TestCreatedByGate_ParentNotInDependsOn_RecipeRejected` (lines 223-249) asserts created_by naming a feature NOT in depends_on is HARD error in BOTH dry-run AND execute, error contains `"is not in depends_on"`, does NOT wrap `ErrPathCreatedByParent`. PRD §4.3 last bullet contract preserved. PASS.

12. **Flag-off behavior** ✅ — `TestCreatedByGate_FlagOff_NoOp` (lines 52-74) with `dagEnabled=false`, created_by set + missing target → bare `"file not found"` error, NO mention of `"will be created by parent feature"`. The downgrade does not leak into flag-off mode. PASS.

13. **The wrong test is gone** ✅ — No test named `TestCreatedByGate_DryRun_HardParent_TargetMissing_Errors` exists. Git log shows the correctness pass had `TestCreatedByGate_HardParent_TargetMissing_ErrPathCreatedByParent` (gate-helper level test, still present at lines 81-102, correct), and C5 ADDED two new recipe-level tests: `..._DowngradesToWarning` (dry-run) and `..._ReturnsErr` (execute). New tests pin the PRD §4.3 split.

### Cross-cutting checks

14. **No scope creep** ✅ — Version still `"0.5.3"` (cobra.go:24). No CHANGELOG entry (`git diff eb4f4f1..HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md` empty). No tag (`git tag --contains HEAD | grep v0.6.0` empty). No skill format updates (`git diff -- assets/` empty). No `tpatch status --dag` (`grep -rn "tpatch status --dag"` empty). No dep-management CLI verbs. No new `ReconcileOutcome` enum values (`grep ReconcileWaitingOnParent|ReconcileBlockedByParent` empty). No new external Go deps (`git diff -- go.mod go.sum` empty). Scope perfectly clean.

15. **No `reconcile-session.json` reads** ✅ — External-reviewer guard: `grep -rn "reconcile-session.json" internal/workflow/recipe.go internal/workflow/reconcile.go` returns ONLY writes (line 499) and comments (lines 40, 447, 450, 472, 497). The new C5 F1 code path at reconcile.go:488-489 short-circuits BEFORE `composeLabelsAt` runs, so it never calls `s.LoadFeatureStatus` → never reads reconcile-session.json. Guard holds.

16. **Regression** ✅ — All critical tests pass: `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` (0.44s), `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow` (0.44s), all M14.1 (Roundtrip/DAG/Dependency), all M14.2 (CreatedByGate gate-helper level), all M14.3 (ComposeLabels/PlanReconcile/EffectiveOutcome/AcceptShadow), correctness-pass tripwires (`TestComposeLabels_ReadsStatusJsonNotSessionArtifact`, `TestReconcile_FlagOn_BlockedByParent_SkipsPhase35`). Full suite `go test ./...` green (all packages cached after targeted runs). Assets parity guard passes (0.344s).

17. **Hygiene** ✅ — `gofmt -l .` empty. No tpatch binary at root (`ls -la tpatch` → not found). All 3 commits carry Co-authored-by trailer (verified via `git log --format='%B' eb4f4f1..HEAD | grep -c "Co-authored-by: Copilot"` returns 3). Working tree clean (`git status --short` empty).

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

All 17 checks pass. Both HIGH-severity F1 findings completely resolved:

- **F1 (HIGH)**: Reconcile-time persistence path now suppresses parent-derived labels for retired outcomes (currently only `ReconcileUpstreamed`) via early short-circuit in `saveReconcileArtifacts` (reconcile.go:488-489) checking `childRetiredOutcomes[result.Outcome]` BEFORE calling `composeLabelsAt`. All 3 phase paths (reverse-apply, op-level, provider-semantic) tested + non-upstreamed control confirms suppression is narrowly scoped. Pre-existing labels wiped (not preserved). Adversarial test from M14.3 still passes.

- **F2 (MEDIUM)**: PRD §4.3 contract now fully implemented. `dryRunOperation` returns `(msg, warning, error)` tuple (recipe.go:87). Hard-parent `ErrPathCreatedByParent` downgrades to a `RecipeExecResult.Warnings` entry in dry-run (lines 110-112), reports op as Applied (deferred), surfaces actionable hint. Execute-mode unchanged (still returns hard error). Soft-parent behavior unchanged (fall-through to not-found + warning). Recipe-shape validation (parent-not-in-depends_on) remains hard error in BOTH modes. CLI dry-run gains `⚠` rendering (cobra.go:471) + warning-count summary (line 478). Locked-in tests split into dry-run vs execute halves.

No scope creep. No regressions. Flag-off byte-identity preserved. Production-ready for M14.4 dispatch.

## Review — M14.3 — 2026-04-26

**Implementer**: m14-3-implementer sub-agent (general-purpose, elapsed unknown)
**Reviewer**: code-review sub-agent (this review)
**Task**: Reconcile topological traversal + composable labels + compound verdict. Third sub-milestone of M14 / Tranche D / v0.6.0. ~1309 LOC across 11 files, gated behind `features_dependencies` flag.

### Commits reviewed (delta vs M14.2 closeout `0ed64cb`)

- `a232a7b` feat(workflow): AcceptShadow refreshes labels (M14.3)
- `4e39384` docs(handoff): M14.3 complete, ready for review

### Checklist

- [x] Builds, tests, gofmt all green
- [x] Parity guard pass (no skill asset changes for M14.3, deferred to M14.4)
- [x] 24 new tests (4 store + 4 PlanReconcile + 11 ComposeLabels + 3 phase-3.5 + 2 AcceptShadow)

- [x] Working tree clean, no tpatch binary

### Critical correctness checks (all 13 pass)

1. **Flag-off byte-identity** ✅ — `TestRoundtrip_PreM14_3StatusByteIdentity` + `TestRoundtrip_EmptyReconcileLabelsOmitted` both do string comparison of round-tripped fixture bytes. `Labels []ReconcileLabel \`json:"labels,omitempty"\`` on line 176 of internal/store/types.go. PlanReconcile gated in reconcile.go:97 preserves input order when flag off. AcceptShadow only invokes ComposeLabels when `cfg.DAGEnabled()` (accept.go:155).

2. **External-reviewer guard (LOAD-BEARING)** ✅ — `TestComposeLabels_ReadsStatusJsonNotSessionArtifact` at internal/workflow/labels_test.go:217-254 is the adversarial test. Seeds misleading `reconcile-session.json` with `outcome: blocked-requires-human` while parent's `status.json` has `Outcome: ReconcileReapplied`. Asserts ComposeLabels returns nil (clean parent → no labels), proving it reads status.json only. Test would fail if session artifact were consulted. Doc comment in labels.go:9-16 explicitly states the load-bearing rule. Implementation at labels.go:110 calls `s.LoadFeatureStatus(dep.Slug)` — no path to reconcile-session.json exists.

3. **ADR-011 D3 (labels ≠ states)** ✅ — `grep -rn "ReconcileWaitingOnParent\|ReconcileBlockedByParent" internal/store/ | grep -v "Label"` returns empty. Only `ReconcileLabel` constants exist (types.go:65-82). `EffectiveOutcome()` at types.go:192-200 computes compound at READ time; no new enum values added to `ReconcileOutcome`. Persisted `Outcome` for compound case is `ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman` (ADR-011 D6 match confirmed).

4. **Phase-3.5 skip + tripwire** ✅ — `TestReconcile_FlagOn_BlockedByParent_SkipsPhase35` at internal/workflow/labels_phase35_test.go:43-118 is the tripwire test. The `tripwireProvider` type (lines 20-36) returns benign stub for phase-3 but calls `t.Errorf` + returns error if a phase-3.5 prompt (containing `"# File:"`) hits Generate. Test sets up child with 3-way conflict + hard parent in `blocked-requires-human`, runs reconcile with `Resolve: true`, and asserts `Phase: "phase-3.5-skipped-blocked-by-parent"` without tripwire firing. Short-circuit logic at reconcile.go:280-292 checks `hasLabel(labels, store.LabelBlockedByParent)` and skips `tryPhase35`.

5. **Compound verdict semantics** ✅ — `EffectiveOutcome()` (types.go:192-200) returns `"blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution"` ONLY when `Outcome == ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman` AND `Labels` contains `LabelBlockedByParent`. All other cases return stringified `Outcome`. Tests: `TestReconcileSummary_EffectiveOutcome_Compound` + `TestEffectiveOutcome_PassthroughWhenNoCompoundLabels`. Soft deps checked: `TestComposeLabels_SoftParentNeverProducesLabel` (labels_test.go:127-138) asserts soft parent in any state produces empty label set (D4 compliance).

6. **PlanReconcile correctness** ✅ — Transitive hard-parent closure at plan_reconcile.go:74-100 (only `dep.Kind != DependencyKindHard` branches continue). Soft deps contribute to ordering (line 108 passes full `allDeps[slug]` to TopologicalOrder) but don't pull themselves into closure. Cycle error augmented at lines 115-118 with `DetectCycles` path. Deterministic order by slug via `TopologicalOrder` (Kahn's with lexicographic tie-break per ADR-011 D2). Flag-off path: reconcile.go:97 only calls PlanReconcile when `cfg.DAGEnabled()`. Tests: `TestPlanReconcile_TransitiveHardClosure`, `TestPlanReconcile_RejectsCycle`, `TestPlanReconcile_FlagOff_PreservesInputOrder`.

7. **AcceptShadow refresh** ✅ — accept.go:149-168 recomputes labels via `ComposeLabels(s, slug)` ONLY when `cfg.DAGEnabled()`. Flag-off preserves prior `Reconcile.Labels` value (stays nil/absent). Tests: `TestAcceptShadow_FlagOn_RefreshesLabels` + `TestAcceptShadow_FlagOff_LabelsRemainNil`.

8. **Label determinism** ✅ — ComposeLabels (labels.go:161) sorts via `sort.Slice(out, func(i, j int) bool { return out[i] < out[j] })`. Alphabetical ordering per ADR-011 D3. Test: `TestComposeLabels_DeterministicOrder` (labels_test.go:186-202) runs ComposeLabels 50× on same fixture, asserts `reflect.DeepEqual` each iteration.

9. **No scope creep** ✅ — No `--dag` command (`grep -rn "tpatch status --dag"` returns empty). No skill updates (`git diff 0ed64cb..HEAD -- assets/` empty). No version bump / CHANGELOG / tag (`git diff -- CHANGELOG.md VERSION` empty). No `created_by` population in implement phase (grep confirms only test writes it — inherited from M14.2). No parent-patch injection (no M12 resolver changes). No new external Go deps (`git diff -- go.mod` empty).

10. **Parity guard** ✅ — `go test ./assets/... -count=1` passes (1.804s).

11. **Regression** ✅ — All critical tests pass: `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful`, `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow`, all M14.1 (DAG/Dependency/Validate/Roundtrip), all M14.2 (dependency gate). Full suite `go test ./... -count=1` green across all packages.

12. **Hygiene** ✅ — `gofmt -l .` empty. `ls -la tpatch` returns empty (no binary). All 5 commits have Co-authored-by trailer (verified via `git log --format='%B' | grep -c "Co-authored-by: Copilot"` returns 5). `git status --short` empty (working tree clean).

13. **Handoff** ✅ — `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md` Status: Review (line 7), implementation summary lines 253-310 accurate, files + test counts match diff stat (11 files, 1309 insertions).

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

All 13 checks pass. Both non-negotiable tests present and correct:
- **Adversarial test** (check #2): `TestComposeLabels_ReadsStatusJsonNotSessionArtifact` enforces ADR-010 D5 source-of-truth rule.
- **Tripwire test** (check #4): `TestReconcile_FlagOn_BlockedByParent_SkipsPhase35` with `tripwireProvider` confirms phase-3.5 short-circuit.

No revisions. No notes. Production-ready for M14.4 user-facing cutover.

## Review — M14.2 — 2026-04-26

**Implementer**: m14-2-implementer sub-agent (general-purpose, 1777s)
**Reviewer**: m14-2-reviewer sub-agent (code-review, 1100s)
**Task**: Apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout. Second sub-milestone of M14 / Tranche D / v0.6.0. ~250 LOC + 6-skill update, gated behind `features_dependencies` flag.

### Commits reviewed (delta vs M14.1 closeout `33ebad0`)

- `24baf92` feat(recipe): add created_by op field + 6-skill rollout
- `9a5f2f3` feat(workflow): add CheckDependencyGate (9 unit tests)
- `4dfe0f1` feat(cli): wire dependency gate into apply (2 integration tests)
- `cdd5484` docs(handoff): M14.2 complete, ready for review

### Checklist

- [x] Builds, tests, gofmt all green
- [x] Parity guard pass (6 skill formats + docs/agent-as-provider.md updated in lockstep)
- [x] 14 new tests (9 gate + 3 recipe round-trip + 2 CLI integration)
- [x] M14.1 regression clean (17/17 tests pass)
- [x] No reconcile drift (`reconcile.go`/`accept.go`/`resolver.go` unchanged — verified by empty `git diff`)
- [x] All 4 commits carry the Co-author trailer
- [x] CURRENT.md accurate

### Critical correctness checks (all 12 pass)

1. **Recipe byte-identity** — `bytes.Equal` round-trip without `created_by` confirmed; v0.5.3 recipes unchanged.
2. **Hard vs soft** — "mixed deps" test asserts ONLY unapplied hard parent in error message; soft + applied hard correctly omitted.
3. **`upstream_merged` + empty `satisfied_by`** — passes (provenance is optional per ADR-011 D5).
4. **`upstream_merged` + non-empty `satisfied_by`** — shape check only (40-hex); `git merge-base` reachability deferred as documented limitation.
5. **Flag-off true no-op** — early return BEFORE any feature-status load.
6. **Sentinel error** — `errors.Is(err, ErrParentNotApplied)` works; 3 tests exercise it.
7. **CLI integration completeness** — single test asserts all 4: non-zero exit + parent in stderr + no tree mutation + child state unchanged.
8. **Wiring** — both `runApplyExecute` (line 540) AND `runApplyAuto` (line 635) call gate BEFORE recipe parsing. `prepare` and `started` correctly NOT gated.
9. **6-skill parity** — Claude SKILL.md L158-160, Copilot L111, Cursor .mdc L113, plus Windsurf/Copilot prompt/Generic workflow all consistent.
10. **External-reviewer guard inheritance** — doc comments on both `CheckDependencyGate` (L34-37) and `CreatedBy` (L67-68) require reading `status.Reconcile.Outcome` not `reconcile-session.json`. M14.3 inherits.
11. **Reconcile untouched** — empty diff verified.
12. **`CreatedBy:` not populated by production code** — grep confirmed only test files write it.

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

No revisions, no notes. Production-ready.

### Action Taken

- SQL: `m14.2-apply-gate` → done. `m14.3-reconcile-topo` → in_progress.
- ROADMAP M14.2 ticked ✅ with commit shas.
- M14.2 handoff archived → HISTORY.md.
- CURRENT.md rewritten for M14.3 (reconcile topological traversal + composable labels + compound verdict, ~500 LOC).
- Auto-chain continues to M14.3 per supervisor plan (will pause before M14.4 — the user-facing release/flip).

## Review — M14.1 — 2026-04-26

**Implementer**: m14-1-implementer sub-agent (general-purpose, 4152s)
**Reviewer**: m14-1-reviewer sub-agent (code-review, 307s)
**Task**: Feature Dependencies data model + validation. First sub-milestone of M14 / Tranche D / v0.6.0. ~300 LOC, gated behind `features_dependencies` flag (default false). No user-visible behavior changes.

### Commits reviewed (delta vs `v0.5.3`)

- `02f1ba9` feat(store): add Dependency type + DAG primitives
- `d166281` feat(store): add dependency validation
- `7dd5941` feat(config): add features_dependencies flag

### Checklist

- [x] Builds, tests, gofmt all green
- [x] 30 new test cases under `internal/store` — all real assertions
- [x] No regressions (`TestGoldenReconcile_*` 7 tests pass)
- [x] Parity guard untouched (`assets/` unchanged)
- [x] Co-author trailer on all 3 commits
- [x] CURRENT.md accurate

### Critical correctness checks (all 10 pass)

1. **Flag-off byte-identity** — `TestRoundtrip_PreM14StatusByteIdentity` does string comparison of round-tripped fixture bytes. `omitempty` works.
2. **Deterministic topo order** — runs `TopologicalOrder` 50× on multi-valid-order graph, `reflect.DeepEqual` each iteration. Sibling ties broken by slug.
3. **Cycle detection** — self-edge detected; DFS returns the cycle path string, not just an error.
4. **5 PRD §3.3 rules** — each with positive + negative test (self-dep, dangling, kind conflict, cycle, satisfied-by-upstream-only) plus invalid-kind guard.
5. **Sentinel errors** — 6 errors, all wrappable via `errors.Is` and exercised in tests.
6. **Flat YAML flag** — round-trips through both repo + global config paths (per zero-dep parser limitation).
7. **External-reviewer guard baked in** — doc comments on `FeatureStatus.DependsOn` and `dag.go` header explicitly state DAG logic must read `status.Reconcile.Outcome` and never `artifacts/reconcile-session.json`. M14.3 inherits this.
8. **Pure DAG functions** — `dag.go` has no IO; `Store` parameter only on validation.
9. **Soft vs hard** — both kinds count equally for topo/cycle; gate-/label-relevance deferred per PRD §6.
10. **Flag is observably inert** — grep confirmed no caller in `cmd/`, `internal/cli/`, or `internal/workflow/` gates on `DAGEnabled` yet. Flag exists; nothing toggles.

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

No revisions. No deferred notes. Data model is load-bearing for M14.2/.3 but fully gated; zero user-visible change until M14.4 cutover.

### Action Taken

- Logged this entry.
- SQL: `m14.1-data-model` → done. `m14.2-apply-gate` → in_progress.
- CURRENT.md rewritten for M14.2 (apply gate + `created_by` recipe op + 6-skill parity-guard rollout, ~250 LOC).
- No version bump / CHANGELOG entry — M14 sub-milestones land behind the flag; the v0.6.0 release ships at M14.4.

## Post-release Review — v0.5.3 follow-up — 2026-04-24

**Reviewer**: external (vscode review session, full `v0.5.2..v0.5.3` delta + targeted probe test)
**Verdict**: **Effectively APPROVED.** Both v0.5.3 fixes verified at the control flow level; full suite + focused `GoldenReconcile|AcceptShadow` run pass. No code-level regressions found.

### Findings (both LOW severity, doc-only)

1. **ADR-010 stale** — D5 still described the resolver writing the full audit to a single `reconcile-session.json`. Code now splits ownership (`resolution-session.json` resolver-owned, `reconcile-session.json` reconcile-owned). Risk: same kind of drift that caused the v0.5.2 dual-writer bug.
   **Fix**: ADR-010 D5 expanded to enumerate the split and call out `status.json` as post-accept source of truth.

2. **Undocumented contract** — manual `reconcile --accept` correctly stamps `status.json.Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied`, but does NOT rewrite `artifacts/reconcile-session.json`, which remains the pre-accept `shadow-awaiting` snapshot. Likely intentional (the artifact audits a `RunReconcile` invocation; `status.json` is current truth) but never explicitly stated.
   **Fix**: doc comment on `saveReconcileArtifacts` in `internal/workflow/reconcile.go` + ADR-010 D5 paragraph make the contract explicit.

### Action Taken

Single docs-only commit on top of v0.5.3 (no version bump — no behavior change). Both findings closed.

## Review — Tranche C3 / v0.5.3 — 2026-04-24

**Implementers**: c3-implementer + c3-finisher sub-agents (general-purpose)
**Reviewer**: c3-reviewer sub-agent (code-review, 381s)
**Task**: Shadow accept accounting fixes — 3 external-reviewer findings on v0.5.2 shadow-accept flow.

### Checklist

- [x] Code compiles: `go build ./cmd/tpatch`
- [x] Tests pass: `go test ./...` (all packages green)
- [x] Formatted: `gofmt -l .` empty
- [x] `.tpatch/` artifacts deterministic; single writer per artifact path
- [x] Secrets safe (N/A)
- [x] CLI behavior matches ADR-010 + ADR-011 D6 prerequisite
- [x] Handoff accurate (CURRENT.md reflects 3/3 landed, deferred release to supervisor per guardrails)
- [x] Parity guard passes (skill/doc drift for artifact path rename resolved)
- [x] No regressions (`TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` still passes)

### Commits reviewed

- `4636878` fix(workflow): split resolver artifact into `resolution-session.json`
- `3ac7465` fix(workflow): `AcceptShadow` stamps `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied`
- `8a4af4b` test(reconcile): end-to-end shadow-awaiting → manual accept regression
- `6024942` docs(handoff): C3 complete

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

### Notes

All three confirmed findings properly fixed:

1. **Dual-writer collision resolved**: Clean schema ownership — `resolution-session.json` (resolver, per-file outcomes) vs `reconcile-session.json` (reconcile, high-level summary). Grep-confirmed single writer per path. `loadResolvedFiles` and `--shadow-diff` read the new path; error messages updated.
2. **Manual accept regression test comprehensive**: `TestGoldenReconcile_ManualAcceptFlow` parses `resolution-session.json` inline (mirrors `loadResolvedFiles`), calls `workflow.AcceptShadow`, asserts merged content + `State=applied` + `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied` + shadow cleared + directory pruned. Would have caught both artifact collision and outcome-stamp bugs in v0.5.2. PASS in 0.45s.
3. **Outcome stamp consistency confirmed uniform**: Both manual (`runReconcileAccept` → `AcceptShadow`) and auto-apply (`tryPhase35` → `AcceptShadow` → outer `updateFeatureState`) paths converge on `Reconcile.Outcome=reapplied`. Auto path has benign double-write (helper sets value, outer `updateFeatureState` sets same value) — idempotent, harmless.

Backward compatibility: acceptable breakage — old `reconcile-session.json` from v0.5.2's resolver not consumed on v0.5.3; re-running `reconcile --resolve` regenerates the correct `resolution-session.json`. Shadow worktrees are ephemeral; no on-disk migration required.

Drift audit synchronized 7 files (5 skill formats + 2 docs). Historical references (CHANGELOG, HISTORY, ADR-010, M12 milestone, M4 phase-4 reconcile summary) intentionally left alone.

Scope discipline: no creep beyond C3.1/C3.2/C3.3. Co-author trailers present on all 4 commits.

### Action Taken

**APPROVED** — proceeding with release:
1. Version bumped 0.5.2 → 0.5.3 (`internal/cli/cobra.go:24`)
2. CHANGELOG v0.5.3 section added
3. ROADMAP M13.6 flipped to ✅
4. Tag v0.5.3 pushed
5. C3 CURRENT.md archived → HISTORY.md; CURRENT.md rewritten for M14.1
6. SQL: `c3-release-v0.5.3` → done, `m14.1-data-model` → in_progress

M14.1 (Feature Dependencies data model, ~300 LOC) unblocked. Implementation sub-agent dispatch next.

## Review — Tranche C2 / v0.5.2 — 2026-04-23

**Implementer**: c2-implementer sub-agent (general-purpose, 6400s)
**Reviewer**: c2-reviewer sub-agent (code-review, 352s)
**Task**: Post-v0.5.1 correctness fix pass — 6 validated findings from review session.

### Checklist

- [x] Code compiles: `go build ./cmd/tpatch`
- [x] Tests pass: `go test ./...` (all packages, with and without cache)
- [x] Formatted: `gofmt -l .` empty
- [x] `.tpatch/` artifacts deterministic (sha256 reproducible from inputs)
- [x] Secrets safe (N/A for this pass)
- [x] CLI behavior matches SPEC.md and shipped v0.5.1 contract
- [x] Handoff accurate
- [x] Assets parity guard passes (skills edited for finding #6)
- [x] No regressions
- [x] 8 regression tests added, each asserting actual behavior (not tautological)
- [x] `ReconcileReapplied` verified unreachable without helper success for shadow-based paths

### Per-finding verdict

1. `c2-resolve-apply-truthful` — ✅ correct. Shared `workflow.AcceptShadow` helper eliminates drift between manual and auto paths. `safety.EnsureSafeRepoPath` called on every file write. Failure preserves shadow + maps to `ReconcileBlockedRequiresHuman`. `TestGoldenReconcile_ResolveApplyTruthful` is the regression guard pre-v0.5.2 code would fail.
2. `c2-refresh-index-clean` — ✅ correct. `GIT_INDEX_FILE` temp approach with deferred unlink on all paths. Regression test byte-compares `git status --porcelain` + checks intent-to-add marker.
3. `c2-recipe-hash-provenance` — ✅ correct. Pointer field enables backward compat. Legacy-sidecar test + content-drift test both pass.
4. `c2-remove-piped-stdin` — ✅ correct. Real `os.Pipe()` in test, not fake reader.
5. `c2-amend-append-flag` — ✅ correct. `--append --reset` mutex enforced with "mutually exclusive" error.
6. `c2-max-conflicts-drift` — ✅ correct. 8 sites (not 6 — agent found 2 more: cursor + windsurf skill formats). Runtime unchanged at 10. Parity guard green.

### Cross-cutting

- Shared helper pattern fully eliminates the manual-vs-auto drift that created finding #1 in the first place.
- Only legitimate `ReconcileReapplied` assignments remaining: phase 4 `ForwardApplyStrict`, phase 4 `ForwardApply3WayClean` (both clean-apply, no shadow), and phase 3.5 after `AcceptShadow` success.
- No terminology/contract drift in docs vs runtime detected.

### Verdict: **APPROVED**

### Action Taken

Updated CHANGELOG v0.5.2 section, bumped `version = "0.5.2"` in `internal/cli/cobra.go`, flipped M13.5 to ✅ in ROADMAP.md, tagged v0.5.2, pushed tag. SQL: 6 c2-* todos → `done`; `c2-release-v0.5.2` → `done`; `m14.1-data-model` unblocked.

## Review — PRD-feature-dependencies — 2026-04-23

**Author**: dag-prd-author sub-agent (3 revision cycles)
**Reviewer**: dag-prd-reviewer rubber-duck sub-agent (3 review passes)
**Task**: Author PRD for stacked feature dependency DAG (v1 backlog item `feat-feature-dependencies`).

### Review trajectory
- **v1 → NEEDS REVISION**: 6 critical issues (semantic contradictions, state composition, dual-source footgun, parity-guard impact, amend/remove vagueness, missing ADR)
- **v2 → NEEDS REVISION**: 5 of 6 resolved + 1 partial; 4 new internal contradictions introduced by the revisions themselves (composability vs exclusivity, drift precedence, `--orphan-soft` scope creep, JSON example bug)
- **v3 → APPROVED WITH NOTES**: all 4 new contradictions resolved; 4 edge cases author self-flagged all accepted; 1 minor terminology drift (`ReconcileWaitingOnParent` enum vs label) deferred to ADR-011 cleanup

### Verdict: **APPROVED WITH NOTES**

### Deliverable
`docs/prds/PRD-feature-dependencies.md` — 736 lines, commit `fa4bbb6`.

### Decisions locked in the PRD (to be reiterated in ADR-011)
1. `depends_on` lives in `status.json` only (no new `feature.yaml`, no migration)
2. DFS for cycle detection
3. Kahn's algorithm for operator-facing topo traversal
4. `waiting-on-parent` / `blocked-by-parent` are composable derived labels (not states)
5. Soft deps do NOT gate `created_by`; hard deps DO
6. `upstream_merged` satisfies hard dependencies
7. `remove --cascade` required to delete parents with dependents (`--force` alone does NOT bypass dep integrity)
8. Parent-patch context NOT passed to M12 resolver in v0.6 (deferred to `feat-resolver-dag-context`)

### Follow-up tranche scope (Tranche D / v0.6.0, 4 milestones)
- M14.1 data model + validation (~300 LOC) — blocked by ADR-011
- M14.2 apply gate + `created_by` + parity-guard rollout (~250 LOC)
- M14.3 reconcile topological traversal + compound verdicts (~500 LOC, bumped)
- M14.4 `status --dag` + skills + release v0.6.0 (~300 LOC, bumped)

### Action Taken
Committed PRD (`fa4bbb6`). SQL todos inserted: `adr-011-feature-dependencies` (blocker), `m14.1` → `m14.4` chain with dependencies. Three follow-ups registered: `feat-resolver-dag-context`, `feat-feature-autorebase`, `feat-amend-dependent-warning`. Parent todo `feat-feature-dependencies` flipped to `done`. ROADMAP M14 block still needs to be populated by supervisor (next step).

- **Recipe stale guard** stored as sidecar `artifacts/recipe-provenance.json` (NOT in `apply-recipe.json`) — preserves parity-guard contract; backward-compat (missing sidecar = silent).
- **Apply default mode** flipped `prepare → auto`. Auto chains existing prepare/execute/done helpers verbatim (line-for-line extraction, no capture re-derivation). Stale-guard still fires inside auto via shared `runApplyExecute`. Breaking UX called out in CHANGELOG.
- **Spinner** wired at single choke point (`GenerateWithRetry`), TTY-guarded, race-free cleanup via `sync.Once` + `<-done`. Tests don't depend on wall-clock.
- **`record --lenient`** shipped as documented escape hatch — implementer ran 4 synthetic repros of the markdown false-positive, all passed reverse-apply cleanly. Without a live reproducer, the documented flag (with stderr warning + error-message hint) is safer than a speculative `--ignore-whitespace` that could mask real divergence. Pragmatic call, accepted.
- No flaky test patterns, no goroutine leaks, no swallowed errors.

### Action Taken
Pushed `main` (`ebb5b7a..e069cd8`) and tag `v0.5.1` to `origin`. Tranche C1 complete; supervisor will pick next tranche when user kicks off.

## 2026-04-17 — M10 Managed Copilot Proxy UX — PENDING REVIEW

**Task**: Implement ADR-004 — honest UX for the reverse-engineered copilot-api proxy + CI release automation.
**Implementer**: M10 agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING**

### Deliverables
- CI release job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`, triggers on `v*` tags, auto-generated notes, prerelease detection. Free (default GITHUB_TOKEN).
- Global config (`internal/store/global.go`) — XDG-honouring loader + saver, merge helper, AUP ack helpers. 0600 file perms.
- Config type (`internal/store/types.go`) — new `CopilotAUPAckAt` field.
- Reachability probe (`internal/provider/probe.go`) — `Reachable`, `IsLocalEndpoint`, `IsCopilotProxyEndpoint`; 2s bound.
- CLI wiring (`internal/cli/copilot.go` + `cobra.go`) — `loadAndProbeProvider` with cached per-process probe, `Execute` now prints errors, AUP warning in `init` / `providerSetCmd` / `autoDetectProvider`.
- Harness doc refresh (`docs/harnesses/copilot.md`) — install path, OS-specific config path, warn-vs-fail rules.
- Tests — `global_test.go` (6), `probe_test.go` (5). All 7 packages green.

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles (`go build ./cmd/tpatch`)
- [x] Tests pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- [x] Formatted (`gofmt -w .` clean)
- [x] Artifacts deterministic (global config is flat YAML with fixed field order)
- [x] Secrets safe (only env var names in config; token never persisted)
- [x] Matches SPEC / ADR-004 (all 8 decisions implemented)
- [x] Handoff accurate (CURRENT.md rewritten with behaviours + pointers)
- [x] Smoke (dead port → hard-fail with install hint; live proxy → falls through)

### Notes
- `TPATCH_NO_PROBE=1` escape hatch added for offline demos / CI steps that only read store state.
- Probe cache is process-scoped; acceptable for one-shot CLI, would need invalidation in a long-running daemon.
- AUP warning copy sits in `internal/cli/copilot.go::copilotAUPWarning` — tweak there, not in harness docs.
- macOS note baked into the harness doc: global config defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/tpatch/config.yaml` unless `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set.

### Action Taken
Archived prior ADR-004/005 CURRENT entry to HISTORY.md; wrote new CURRENT for this implementation; awaiting supervisor review before commit.

## 2026-04-17 — ADR-004 (M10 UX) + ADR-005 (M11 native provider) — PENDING REVIEW

**Task**: Lock in decisions for M10 and M11 through interactive Q&A with the user; capture as two ADRs.
**Implementer**: Planning agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING** (plan only, no code)

### Deliverables
- `docs/adrs/ADR-004-m10-copilot-proxy-ux.md` — 8 decisions: no process supervision, upstream proxy pointer, global+repo config loader, reachability probe behaviour, no log piping, first-run AUP warning, Windows deferred, enterprise deferred to M11.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-005-m11-native-copilot-provider.md` — 10 decisions: **follow copilot-api/litellm's session-token exchange** rather than opencode's simpler Bearer path, file-based token storage at XDG_DATA_HOME (keychain deferred), long-lived OAuth with retry-and-relogin on 401, enterprise prompt at login, no persistent model cache, overridable headers with copilot-api defaults, distinct `copilot-native` type, opt-in gate, no streaming, no default rate-limit.
- Updated PRD to reflect the session-token-exchange direction and add litellm/copilot-api references.
- Research finding: of the three reference implementations (opencode, ericc-ch/copilot-api, litellm), **two of three use the session-token exchange** with `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`. Adopting that pattern gives us the most field-exposed, proven surface and makes Phase 2 behaviourally identical to Phase 1 (only the transport changes).

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — no code change
- [x] Tests pass — unchanged
- [x] Formatted — unchanged
- [x] Matches SPEC — ADRs respect the stable `Provider` interface
- [x] Handoff accurate — CURRENT.md rewritten; ROADMAP updated; PRD revised
- [x] ADRs cover the architecturally significant decisions (per AGENTS.md)

### Notes
- The single biggest revision from the previous PRD draft is the M11 transport choice. opencode's path would have been ~200 LOC; the copilot-api path is ~350–400 LOC but substantially safer because it uses the client ID and exchange flow that GitHub's own editor plugins use. User priority of "simpler = proven" drove this.
- Both ADRs explicitly carry the two open questions (legal/ToS on editor headers, GitHub roadmap for an official endpoint) as hard gates before merge.

### Action Taken
No code merged. ADRs ready for supervisor review. Awaiting user direction on (a) GitHub Release automation for v0.3.0, (b) whether to start M10 implementation now.

---

## 2026-04-17 — Native Copilot Auth Research + PRD — APPROVED (superseded by ADR-004/005)

**Task**: Plan what it takes to have "native" copilot auth as a tpatch provider; verify whether copilot-api is officially supported (it is not) and whether github/copilot-cli is open source (it is not).
**Implementer**: Planning agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING** (plan only, no code)

### Deliverables
- `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md` — options matrix (A–E), two-phase recommendation (M10 managed proxy, M11 opt-in native OAuth-device-flow provider), explicit rejection of shelling out to `copilot` CLI.
- Confirmed via the `tesseracode/copilot-api` README that it is reverse-engineered, unsupported by GitHub, and subject to abuse-detection warnings.
- Confirmed via the `github/copilot-cli` repo contents that the CLI is closed-source (only README/install.sh/changelog/LICENSE are published) and the only sanctioned auth surface is `/login` OAuth or a PAT with "Copilot Requests" permission — no documented HTTP endpoint.
- **Confirmed via anomalyco/opencode source** that a much simpler native path is proven in production: OAuth device flow against `github.com` with the well-known editor client ID (`Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz`), GitHub OAuth access token used directly as Bearer on `api.githubcopilot.com`. **No session-token exchange required** — this removes the biggest implementation-cost concern from the initial draft of the PRD. M11 is now ~200 LOC of Go rather than a full copilot-api reimplementation.

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — no code change in this session
- [x] Tests pass — unchanged (last run post-v0.3.0 all green)
- [x] Formatted — unchanged
- [x] Secrets safe — PRD recommends env-var-reference pattern unchanged
- [x] Matches SPEC — PRD respects stable `Provider` interface
- [x] Handoff accurate — CURRENT.md rewritten; distribution entry archived to HISTORY.md
- [ ] ADRs for technical decisions — ADR-004 deferred until the open legal question is answered

### Notes
- Key finding: there is no officially documented public Copilot HTTP endpoint, so every "native" path is on reverse-engineered surface. The PRD faces this head-on and recommends going no faster than the policy allows.
- The PRD intentionally rejects shelling out to `copilot` CLI (Option D) because each prompt burns a premium request and copilot re-runs its own agent loop — incompatible with tpatch's deterministic workflow phases.
- M11 (native PAT provider) is soft-blocked on a policy question: can a third-party tool legitimately identify as an editor against `api.githubcopilot.com`? If "no", Phase 1 managed proxy is the ceiling.

### Action Taken
Session ended pending supervisor approval of the PRD. No code merged; v0.3.0 was tagged earlier in this session and is ready to push.

---

## 2026-04-17 — Distribution Setup (module rename + CI workflow) — APPROVED

**Task**: Make `go install` work and add a free CI workflow.
**Implementer**: Distribution agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING**

### Deliverables
- `go.mod` module renamed to `github.com/tesseracode/tesserapatch` (matches the actual GitHub repo). All imports rewritten. Binary still named `tpatch`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: push+PR to `main`, matrix ubuntu + macOS, `gofmt` + `go vet` + `go build` + `go test` + `go install` smoke test. `go-version-file: go.mod`, module cache enabled, concurrency group cancels superseded runs.
- `README.md` install block updated to the correct module path.

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — `go build ./cmd/tpatch` OK
- [x] Tests pass — all 7 packages green post-rename
- [x] Formatted — `gofmt -l .` clean
- [x] Artifacts deterministic — no runtime behavior change; rename is mechanical
- [x] Secrets safe — workflow declares `permissions: contents: read`; no tokens needed for build/test
- [x] Matches SPEC — CLI contract unchanged
- [x] Handoff accurate — CURRENT.md rewritten; prior refinement archived to HISTORY.md

### Notes
- Free for public repos (unlimited Actions minutes). Private repos get 2000 min/month on the free plan, which is still plenty for our workload.
- `go install ...@latest` requires the repo to be public (or Go's proxy to have access). Repo owner action item: flip visibility to public, push, tag `v0.3.0`.
- The `--preset copilot` question: it targets the `copilot-api` proxy at `localhost:4141`, not GitHub's Copilot directly. Same GitHub account is used because copilot-api does its own OAuth. Documented in CURRENT.md.

### Action Taken
Session ended pending supervisor approval.

## 2026-04-17 — Phase 2 Refinement (SDK evaluation + harness guides + tracking cadence) — APPROVED WITH NOTES

**Task**: Evaluate OpenRouter/OpenAI/Anthropic Go SDKs and codex/copilot-cli harnesses; adopt the simplest integration without wasting resources; tighten agent tracking cadence.
**Implementer**: Phase 2 refinement agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING** (awaiting supervisor checklist pass)

### Deliverables

**Provider layer (SDK decision)**
- Surveyed `OpenRouterTeam/go-sdk` (Speakeasy-generated, README labels "not production-ready"), `openai/openai-go`, `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go`.
- **Rejected all three SDKs** — our `Check` + `Generate` surface does not benefit from them and adoption would add ~20 transitive deps.
- **Accepted** preset-based ergonomics instead: `tpatch provider set --preset copilot|openai|openrouter|anthropic|ollama`.
- `providerPresets` map is the single source of truth for both `--preset` and `autoDetectProvider`.

**Harness integration**
- `docs/harnesses/codex.md` — codex exec handshake, `AGENTS.md` snippet, recommended approval policy, anti-patterns.
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` — Copilot CLI skill placement, allow-list configuration, MCP follow-up flagged as M10.

**Tracking cadence**
- `AGENTS.md` "Context Preservation Rules" now declares cadence per trigger (started task, finished phase, hit blocker, milestone flipped) with an explicit cheatsheet table.
- `CLAUDE.md` Working Rules reference the cadence and call out per-phase (not per-session) handoff updates.

**Documents**
- `docs/adrs/ADR-003-sdk-evaluation.md` — full evaluation matrix and locked-in decision.

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — `go build ./cmd/tpatch` OK
- [x] Tests pass — `go test ./...` green across 7 packages; `TestProviderSetPreset` added
- [x] Formatted — `gofmt -l .` clean
- [x] Artifacts deterministic — preset map is static; no behavior change to apply recipes
- [x] Secrets safe — presets still store env-var *names*, not values
- [x] Matches SPEC — `provider set` contract extended additively; no regressions
- [x] Handoff accurate — CURRENT.md updated, old Phase 2 entry archived to HISTORY.md

### Notes
- `--preset` composes with `--type/--base-url/--model/--auth-env` so users can nudge a preset (e.g. `--preset anthropic --model claude-opus-4`) without reconfiguring everything.
- The harness guides deliberately avoid prescribing an SDK path — both codex and copilot-cli are agents, not libraries, and the `tpatch next --format harness-json` CLI contract is the supported integration surface.
- M10 (`tpatch mcp serve`) is called out as a future follow-up if/when Copilot CLI or codex standardize on MCP as the preferred integration.

### Action Taken
Session ended pending supervisor approval. HISTORY.md updated with the prior Phase 2 entry so the log reflects sequential state transitions.

## 2026-04-17 — M7 + M8 + M9 Phase 2 Implementation — APPROVED WITH NOTES

**Task**: Ship Phase 2 milestones: provider integration, LLM validation with retry, interactive/harness commands
**Implementer**: Phase 2 implementation agent
**Verdict**: **PENDING** (awaiting supervisor checklist pass)

### Deliverables

**M7 — Provider**
- `AnthropicProvider` (internal/provider/anthropic.go) speaking Messages API (`x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`, content blocks, top-level `system`).
- `provider.NewFromConfig(cfg)` factory; `loadProviderFromStore` routes by `cfg.Type`.
- Auto-detection extended: Ollama (localhost:11434), ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
- `provider set --type` flag; `config set provider.type` validates `openai-compatible|anthropic`.
- `ADR-002-provider-strategy.md` written.

**M8 — Validation & Retry**
- `workflow.GenerateWithRetry` + `JSONObjectValidator`, `NonEmptyValidator`.
- Raw responses logged to `artifacts/raw-<phase>-response-N.txt`.
- `max_retries` config (default 2); `--no-retry` flag on 4 workflow commands, plumbed via `workflow.WithDisableRetry(ctx)`.
- Workflow functions (`RunAnalysis`, `RunDefine`, `RunExplore`, `RunImplement`) use the retry helper; heuristic fallback preserved when the retry budget is exhausted.

**M9 — Interactive & Harness**
- `tpatch cycle <slug>` — full lifecycle; `--interactive`, `--editor`, `--skip-execute`, `--timeout`.
- `tpatch test <slug>` — runs `config.test_command`, records `test-output.txt` + `apply-session.json` validation status.
- `tpatch next <slug>` — state-aware next-action emitter; `--format harness-json` for structured harness integration.
- All 6 skill formats updated; parity guard extended for `cycle`, `test`, `next`.
- Version bumped to `0.3.0-dev`.

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — `go build ./cmd/tpatch` OK
- [x] Tests pass — `go test ./...` green across 7 packages (adds Anthropic/factory, retry, cycle/test/next tests)
- [x] Formatted — `gofmt -l .` clean
- [x] Artifacts deterministic — raw-response logging is per-attempt, recipe execution unchanged
- [x] Secrets safe — Anthropic auth still by env-var reference (AuthEnv); no secrets touched
- [x] Matches SPEC — new commands documented in all 6 skill formats; parity guard enforces it
- [x] Handoff accurate — CURRENT.md updated; ROADMAP M7/M8/M9 marked ✅

### Notes
- `Provider` interface unchanged; adding providers is purely additive.
- `--no-retry` uses a context value rather than changing every workflow signature — minimal blast radius.
- `tpatch next` distinguishes sub-states of `defined` (needs explore vs implement vs apply) by probing the feature directory, so the harness contract stays meaningful across phases.

### Action Taken
Session ended pending supervisor approval.

## 2026-04-16 — Gap Closure (8 gaps) — APPROVED

**Task**: Close 8 gaps from unified review before supervisor handoff  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED**

**ADR-001 (cobra dependency)**: Acknowledged. Justified deviation — stdlib `flag` cannot parse interspersed flags.

**Gaps Closed**:
- [x] GAP 1 (HIGH): Wired `EnsureSafeRepoPath()` into `store.WriteArtifact()` and `store.WriteFeatureFile()` — every file write path-checks against repo root
- [x] GAP 2 (HIGH): `apply --mode done` now writes `apply-session.json` with operator notes, validation status, timestamps. New flags: `--note`, `--validation-status`, `--validation-note`
- [x] GAP 3 (HIGH): `record` generates `record.md` with change summary, file count, replay instructions
- [x] GAP 4 (HIGH): Incremental patch derivation for multi-feature reconciliation via `DeriveIncrementalPatch()` + reconciler prefers `incremental.patch` over cumulative
- [x] GAP 5 (MEDIUM): `apply --mode done --validation-note` writes `manual-validation.md`
- [x] GAP 6 (LOW): Provider auto-detection on `tpatch init` — probes localhost:4141, checks OPENAI_API_KEY env var
- [x] GAP 7 (LOW): Sequential patch numbering — `WritePatch()` creates `patches/001-apply.patch`, `002-record.patch`, etc.
- [x] GAP 8 (MEDIUM): Recipe dry-run (`--dry-run`) and auto-execute (`--mode execute`) with per-operation path safety via `EnsureSafeRepoPath()`

**New files**:
- `internal/workflow/recipe.go` — Recipe executor: `DryRunRecipe()`, `ExecuteRecipe()`, `LoadRecipe()` with per-operation safety

**Tests**: All 6 packages pass, gofmt clean, build clean.

---

## 2026-04-16 — M6 Bug Bash (Live Provider Run) — APPROVED

**Task**: M6 — Final bug bash with live copilot-api provider (claude-sonnet-4)  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED**

**New Features Added**:
- [x] Automated patch validation on `record` (prints "Patch validated: applies cleanly")
- [x] `merge_strategy` config option (`3way` default, `rebase` available)
- [x] `ValidatePatch()` in gitutil with strategy-aware checking
- [x] Enriched Phase 3 prompt: `extractUpstreamContext()` reads affected files from current upstream, giving the LLM actual code to compare

**Live Provider Bug Bash Results**:
- [x] Provider: copilot-api at localhost:4141, model claude-sonnet-4 (44 models available)
- [x] Analysis: Live LLM produced detailed analysis with correct file paths and acceptance criteria
- [x] Feature A → `upstream_merged` (Phase 3: live LLM analyzed upstream `src/lib/model-mapping.ts` and confirmed equivalence)
- [x] Feature B → `reapplied` (Phase 4: live LLM said "still_needed", patch forward-applied with 3-way)
- [x] Both patches auto-validated: "Patch validated: applies cleanly"
- [x] Target repo: `bun test` 26/26, `bun run typecheck` clean
- [x] `go test ./...` all pass (7 packages)

**Key Improvement**: Previous runs with mock provider returned hardcoded responses. This run used a real LLM (claude-sonnet-4) which initially returned `unclear` because the prompt lacked upstream code context. After adding `extractUpstreamContext()`, the LLM correctly identified Feature A as upstreamed by comparing the acceptance criteria against the actual `src/lib/model-mapping.ts` content.

---

## 2026-04-16 — M6 Bug Bash (Re-test after fixes) — APPROVED

**Task**: M6 — Pass reconciliation bug bash after fixing BUG-1, BUG-2, BUG-3  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED**

**Bug Fixes Applied**:
- [x] BUG-1: Migrated CLI from stdlib `flag` to `cobra/pflag` — flags work in any position
- [x] BUG-2: Rewrote `CapturePatch()` with `git add --intent-to-add` + trailing newline fix
- [x] BUG-3: Added `--from <commit>` flag to `record` for committed diffs
- [x] BONUS: Added 3-way merge fallback to `ForwardApplyCheck()` / `ForwardApply()`

**Re-test Results**:
- [x] Feature A (model-id-translation-fix) → `upstream_merged` (Phase 3 provider-assisted)
- [x] Feature B (models-cli-subcommand) → `reapplied` (Phase 4 forward-apply with 3-way merge)
- [x] Target repo: `bun test` 26/26 pass
- [x] Target repo: `bun run typecheck` clean
- [x] Feature A patch validates: `git apply --check` passes on baseline
- [x] Feature B patch validates: `git apply --check` passes on Feature A commit
- [x] `apply slug --mode done` works (BUG-1 regression test)
- [x] `go test ./...` all pass (7 packages)
- [x] `gofmt -l .` clean

**Architecture Change**: Added `github.com/spf13/cobra` dependency — breaks zero-dependency constraint, but user approved. The stdlib `flag` package fundamentally cannot support interspersed flags (flags after positional args).

**Notes**: The cobra migration also gives us free: shell completion generation, auto help text, subcommand hierarchy for `provider check/set` and `config show/set`.

## 2026-04-16 — M6 Bug Bash (Initial) — APPROVED WITH NOTES

**Task**: M6 — Run reconciliation bug bash against tesseracode/copilot-api  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED WITH NOTES**

**What Passed**:

**Action**: All 3 bugs fixed in follow-up session. Re-test passed.

---

## 2026-04-16 — M5 Skill System — APPROVED

**Task**: M5 — 6 harness formats, embedded assets, parity guard

- [x] Phase 3: Provider-assisted semantic detection (with mock provider)
- [x] Phase 4: Forward-apply attempt (reapplication)
- [x] 4 test scenarios: upstreamed, reapplied, provider-assisted, blocked
- [x] Reconciliation artifacts: reconcile-session.json, reconcile.md, per-version logs
- [x] State transitions: applied → upstream_merged / applied / blocked
- [x] upstream.lock updated after reconciliation

---

## 2026-04-16 — M3 Apply & Record — APPROVED

**Task**: M3 — implement, apply (3 modes), record, patch capture  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED**

- [x] Apply recipe format (JSON operations)
- [x] `apply --mode prepare/started/done` lifecycle
- [x] `record` captures tracked + untracked files
- [x] Patch excludes .tpatch/, skill dirs, framework files
- [x] gitutil: HeadCommit, CapturePatch, CaptureDiffStat, reverseApply, forwardApply

---

## 2026-04-16 — M2 Provider & Analysis — APPROVED

**Task**: M2 — Provider interface, analyze, define, explore, heuristic fallback  
**Verdict**: **APPROVED**

- [x] OpenAI-compatible provider (raw net/http)
- [x] 4 provider tests (check, generate, auth header, failure)
- [x] Analyze with workspace snapshot and guidance file detection
- [x] Define with acceptance criteria generation
- [x] Explore with file tree and changeset identification
- [x] Heuristic fallback for all 3 commands (works offline)
- [x] provider check and provider set commands

---

## Review — M11 — 2026-04-18

**Reviewer**: implementation self-report (pending external review)
**Task**: Native Copilot provider (ADR-005)

### Checklist
- [x] Compiles — `go build ./cmd/tpatch` → `tpatch 0.4.0-dev`
- [x] Tests pass — `go test ./... -count=1` all 7 packages green
- [x] Formatted — `gofmt -l .` clean
- [x] Artifacts deterministic — no runtime artifacts added in this cut
- [x] Secrets safe — OAuth token stored at 0600, parent-dir checks, `TPATCH_COPILOT_AUTH_FILE` for tests, symlink rejection
- [x] Matches SPEC / ADR-005 D1–D10
- [x] Handoff accurate (see `docs/handoff/CURRENT.md`)

### Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES (pending external)

### Notes
- Provider-level unit tests (httptest fake for device flow + session
