# Current Handoff

## Active Task
- **Task ID**: ADR-004 (M10 proxy UX) + ADR-005 (M11 native provider)
- **Milestone**: Planning locked-in for M10 and M11
- **Description**: User chose interactively through open questions; decisions captured as two ADRs. PRD updated to match the session-token-exchange direction (copilot-api/litellm pattern) instead of opencode's simpler path.
- **Status**: ADRs written, awaiting supervisor review
- **Assigned**: 2026-04-17

## Session Summary

1. **Committed Phase 2 work** as commit `dc42718` ("Phase 2 (v0.3.0): providers, validation, interactive/harness, distribution"). Includes all M7/M8/M9, refinement, and distribution changes.
2. **Released v0.3.0** — bumped version constant from `0.3.0-dev` to `0.3.0`, committed as `305781d`, tagged `v0.3.0` with a full release note. Tag is local; repo owner still needs to `git push origin main --tags`.
3. **Researched Copilot auth options**:
   - Pulled `tesserabox/copilot-api` README — explicitly "reverse-engineered proxy… not supported by GitHub… may trigger abuse-detection systems."
   - Pulled `github/copilot-cli` README and repo root listing — **not open source** (only README, install.sh, changelog, LICENSE published; the CLI is a closed-source binary on Homebrew/npm/WinGet). Official auth paths: `/login` OAuth or `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` with "Copilot Requests" PAT permission.
   - Conclusion: **GitHub does not publish a public OpenAI-compatible Copilot endpoint.** Every third-party integration (copilot-api, Claude Code via proxy, tpatch) is on reverse-engineered surface.
4. **Wrote PRD** (`docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`) with 5 options evaluated and a two-phase recommendation: M10 managed-proxy UX (`copilot-start` / `copilot-stop` / `copilot-status`), then M11 opt-in native PAT provider calling `api.githubcopilot.com` directly. Shelling out to `copilot` CLI explicitly rejected (burns premium requests, re-runs its own agent loop).

## Files Created
- `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`

## Files Changed
- `internal/cli/cobra.go` — version `0.3.0-dev` → `0.3.0` (committed)

## Git State
- `dc42718` — Phase 2 feature commit
- `305781d` — "Release v0.3.0" (version bump)
- `v0.3.0` — tag on 305781d
- **Not yet pushed.** Repo owner needs `git push origin main && git push origin v0.3.0`.

## Test Results
- `gofmt -l .` clean
- `go test ./...` — all 7 packages pass
- `tpatch --version` → `tpatch 0.3.0`

## Key Decisions (captured in ADR-004 and ADR-005)

**M10 — copilot-api UX (ADR-004)**
- No process supervision; we warn when unreachable, point at install instructions.
- Upstream `ericc-ch/copilot-api` is the recommended proxy; internal TODO to revisit the tesserabox fork if its fixes become blocking.
- New global config at `~/.config/tpatch/config.yaml`; per-repo `.tpatch/config.yaml` overrides.
- Reachability probe on first call (`GET /v1/models`, 2s timeout); warn-but-continue on `init`, hard-fail on workflow commands.
- First-run AUP warning stored in global config; no log piping; Windows deferred.

**M11 — native Copilot provider (ADR-005)**
- **Changed direction**: port ericc-ch/copilot-api's internal flow (session-token exchange via `copilot_internal/v2/token` + VS Code Copilot Chat client ID `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`) rather than opencode's simpler Bearer-the-OAuth-token path. copilot-api and litellm both use this flow → proven, field-exposed surface that matches what Copilot's own editor plugins do.
- Token storage: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tpatch/copilot-auth.json`, chmod 0600. OS keychain deferred.
- OAuth token treated as long-lived; 401 triggers one retry then "run copilot-login again".
- Device-flow prompts for GitHub.com vs Enterprise; Enterprise domain captured at login.
- `GET /models` every session, no persistent cache.
- Editor headers overridable via `provider.headers_override`; `x-initiator` opt-in, unset by default.
- `type: copilot-native` distinct from `type: openai-compatible` + copilot proxy.
- Opt-in gate with AUP acknowledgement in global config.

## Blockers
- None for the PRD itself.
- M11 (native provider) is soft-blocked on the "can we ship the editor header set?" legal question noted in the PRD.

## Next Steps
1. **Repo owner**: decide whether to create a GitHub Release for v0.3.0 (or add `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` to CI for automation on future tags).
2. **Before M11 implementation begins**: answer the two open questions in the PRD and ADR-005 (legal/ToS on editor headers; GitHub roadmap for an official endpoint).
3. **Next agent session — M10 implementation** per ADR-004: add global-config loader, reachability probe in provider-set/init flow, first-run AUP warning helper.
4. **After M10 lands — M11 implementation** per ADR-005, gated on the open questions.

## Context for Next Agent
- PRD lives at `docs/prds/PRD-native-copilot-auth.md`. It includes the full options matrix and the rejection rationale for each alternative.
- The `Provider` interface is stable and Phase 1 does not need to touch it at all — the managed proxy still routes through the existing `OpenAICompatible` code path. Phase 2 adds a sibling struct.
- `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` already documents the current manual setup; update it when M10 lands.
- GitHub has explicitly warned users in copilot-api's README about abuse-detection. Our UX for M10/M11 must surface that warning prominently.
