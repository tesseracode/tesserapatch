# Current Handoff

## Status

**Cluster state**: IN PROGRESS

The research-intake/GH #13 planning wave is durably closed at
`d3454edb72c37bacae9159481cc2e6cd69559459`; its acceptance is preserved in
[HISTORY](HISTORY.md). The operator has paused GH #13 to investigate whether
the inherited resource-admission policy unnecessarily prevents older-Mac tests.
Only an instrumented baseline is authorized; a relaxed candidate is undecided.

## Active Task

- **Task ID**: `calibrate-test-resource-admission`
- **Milestone**: Validation infrastructure investigation, before GH #13
- **Description**: Measure baseline resource use before choosing any admission change
- **Status**: In progress — older-host checkout/toolchain isolation decision pending
- **Assigned**: 2026-10-08
- **WAVE_BASE**: `d3454edb72c37bacae9159481cc2e6cd69559459`
- **Frozen source baseline**: `d3454edb72c37bacae9159481cc2e6cd69559459`

## Session Summary

The user asked why 80% is required, what peak resource use was recorded, and
whether a measured comparison can make testing viable on the older Mac.
The user selected an instrumented baseline only, with candidate selection
after measurements, on the separately reachable older machine.

Direct inspection confirms the threshold was an admission policy, not a
measured suite memory requirement. The Makefile has eight correctness/durability
checks; Git/document checks 1-5 are distinct from formatting (6), vet/build (7)
and the complete fresh 22-invocation test partition (8). The shard script
already serializes packages and Go execution with `-p=1` and `GOMAXPROCS=1`.
Observer tests intentionally launch child `go test` processes.

Prior logs sampled before commands, not throughout execution. Historical
admission observations survive in LOG/HISTORY, but no trustworthy peak process-
tree RSS, runtime pressure maximum or runtime process-count maximum was recorded.
The temporary helpers/logs were removed at the prior wave's completed cleanup.

## Current State

- Current host: 32 GiB RAM, ten physical/logical CPUs; Go version file 1.26.5.
- Older host: 16 GiB RAM, four physical/eight logical CPUs, Intel; Go 1.27.1.
- Older-host read-only samples: admission metric 81-84%, zero swap used,
  load1 above 5. This is not test-generated load or a runtime peak measurement.
- Its checkout is at `75d80f0`, with untracked historical research; do not
  overwrite, clean or fast-forward it across those files.
- Need a clean isolated baseline checkout and an explicitly matched toolchain
  before a comparison can isolate resource-policy effects.
- Keep >=80% admission, load1 <=5, no competing Go/test tools and a fresh
  continuous 60-second window. No relaxed policy or artificial stress authorized.
- Tests, assertions, selectors, serial settings and timeouts remain unchanged.
- Capture continuous measurements and durable summaries in the new experiment;
  distinguish sampled RSS sums from exact physical footprint/high-water marks.

## Files Changed

- CURRENT, ROADMAP and supervisor LOG: investigation scope and discovered
  limitations. No runtime, test-source, CI, shard-script or policy changes.

## Test Results

No Go validation has run for this task. Read-only SSH, hardware/resource queries,
source inspection and history lookup succeeded. Prior acceptance remains valid:
local gate 8/8 at `bd13671`, exact-checkpoint native run `37871315522` SUCCESS,
terminal tracking pushed at `d3454ed`. That evidence contains no resource profile.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm isolated checkout and toolchain setup for the older-Mac baseline.
2. Instrument admission and execution separately, retaining raw measurements,
   stage outcomes, workload identity, cache/toolchain context and a summary.
3. Run only if the existing admission rule qualifies. If it cannot, report
   admission-blocked without inventing test resource requirements.
4. Select any relaxed experiment only after discussing the baseline results.
   GH #13 implementation remains paused and separately authorized.

## Blockers

The older checkout/source and compiler differ from the validated baseline.
Do not use them as an uncontrolled comparison or alter existing research.

## Context for Next Agent

- No permanent threshold adjustment, synthetic memory pressure, termination of
  other users' processes, release, tag or #13 runtime implementation is authorized.
- Keep old research and accepted ADR-043/ADR-037/PRD rev-7 unchanged.
- The prior ADR index and frozen ADR-041 sections are guarded snapshots; do not
  edit their historical status wording for this infrastructure investigation.
- Access details are session-local, not repository documentation.
- `-count=1` forces test execution; compiled Go artifacts may still be cached.
  A warm/cold-cache difference must not be attributed to admission thresholds.
