**Study ID**: `t3code-upstream-v0.0.23-2026-05`
**Date**: 2026-05-13/14
**Upstream delta**: 62 commits (v0.0.21 lock → v0.0.23)
**Features**: 25 total, 14 re-applied, 1 upstreamed (pre-reconcile), 2 false-positive upstreamed, 2 true conflicts, 6 not yet implemented

**Revision**: Post-review correction on 2026-05-14. Two `upstreamed` verdicts were false positives caught by independent reviewers.

## Key Findings for Middle-pass Research

### 0. CRITICAL: `upstreamed` verdicts are unreliable (post-review finding)

Both features marked `upstreamed` by tpatch reconcile were **false positives**:

- **`session-search`**: No upstream session search exists — no keybinding, no component, no state in ChatView. The reconciler matched refactored component structure against recipe operations without verifying that the actual search functionality was present. **Trusting this verdict would have caused feature loss.**
- **`copilot-skill-controls`**: The recipe only contained a `try/catch` around skill discovery (error-handling scaffolding). That code exists because it was part of the monolithic CopilotAdapter brought by `copilot-cli-provider`. The feature's actual intent (enable/disable/reload RPC calls + toggle UI) was never implemented.

**Root cause**: tpatch's phase-2 operation-level matching checks whether recipe search strings exist in the upstream tree, but doesn't verify semantic equivalence. A recipe that searches for `try { await session.skills` will match any codebase containing that pattern — even if the pattern is from a different feature entirely.

**Impact**: 100% false positive rate on `upstreamed` verdicts (0/2 correct). This is the most dangerous class of error — it silently drops features.

### 1. Verdict accuracy: tpatch `blocked` is overly conservative

Of 15 features marked `blocked` by `tpatch reconcile`:
- **9 (60%)** reapplied cleanly — patches are entirely additive (new files, new array entries) with zero overlap against upstream changes
- **4 (27%)** needed minor relocation — insertion points shifted but the semantic content was unchanged
- **2 (13%)** were true conflicts — upstream restructured the desktop app heavily enough that our IPC/environment code needs a full rewrite

**Implication**: A structural middle-pass that can distinguish "additive patch vs overlapping patch" would eliminate ~87% of false `blocked` verdicts.

### 2. Additive patches dominate fork customization

The copilot provider feature is the largest (43 hunks, 18 files) but touches zero upstream files destructively. It adds:
- New files: CopilotDriver.ts, CopilotAdapter.ts, CopilotProvider.ts, etc.
- Array entries: builtInDrivers, PROVIDER_OPTIONS, RuntimeEventRawSource union
- Schema extensions: CopilotSettings, providers struct field

A middle-pass system that tracks "file is new" vs "file is modified" would correctly classify most copilot hunks as `applies-clean` without needing AST analysis.

### 3. Relocation patterns are consistent and predictable

The 4 features that needed relocation all followed the same pattern:
- **Type**: insertion-point shift (upstream added entries before/after our insertion point)
- **Fix**: find the equivalent anchor (e.g., the `ultrathink` block for effort-theming, the provider list for README) and insert after it
- **Difficulty**: trivial for a human, but requires semantic understanding of "equivalent anchor"

### 4. Upstream absorption is detectable at operation level

Both upstreamed features (`session-search`, `copilot-skill-controls`) were correctly detected by tpatch's phase-2 operation-level check — "all recipe operations already present in upstream." This is the one area where tpatch's current heuristics work well.

### 5. True conflicts correlate with upstream restructure scope

The 2 true conflicts (`desktop-managed-environments-connections`, `windows-wsl-support`) share a root cause: upstream restructured `apps/desktop/src/` from a flat layout to `app/`, `backend/`, `electron/` subdirectories. Our features added files and IPC channels to the old layout. This is a **structural conflict** detectable by path-prefix analysis without reading file contents.

## Adaptation Taxonomy

| Adaptation | Count | Automatable? |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| New API parameter (maintenanceCapabilities) | 1 | Partially — needs type inference |
| Lint rule compliance (barrel → namespace imports) | 1 | Yes — mechanical transform |
| Type union extension (add new literals) | 1 | Yes — pattern matching |
| Effect wrapper (plain → Effect.succeed) | 1 | Partially — needs type context |
| Insertion point relocation | 2 | Needs anchor matching |
| Content rewrite (README format change) | 1 | Needs semantic understanding |

## Data Files

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `study.json` | 1 | Study metadata and parameters |
| `features.jsonl` | 25 | Per-feature outcomes with ground-truth labels |
| `hunks.jsonl` | 53 | Per-hunk metadata (path, header, line counts, hash) |
| `patches.jsonl` | 4 | Per-commit patch summaries |
| `metrics.json` | 1 | Aggregate metrics and verdict accuracy |

## Recommendations for tpatch

1. **CRITICAL: Fix `upstreamed` false positives**: Operation-level matching must verify semantic equivalence, not just string presence. A recipe operation "search for X" should not match if X exists in a *different* feature's code. Consider requiring that the matched code was *introduced by upstream* (not by a sibling feature in the fork).
2. **Add `upstreamed` confidence scores**: When marking a feature as upstreamed, include which upstream commit introduced the matched operations and a confidence score. Low-confidence verdicts should be flagged for manual review.
3. **Never auto-retire on `upstreamed`**: The current workflow transitions `upstreamed` features to `upstream_merged` with the note "Feature adopted by upstream — local patch retired." This is dangerous when the verdict is wrong. Require explicit human confirmation before retiring.
4. **Add file-level novelty classification**: "new file" patches should auto-classify as `applies-clean`, not `blocked`
5. **Add hunk-level overlap detection**: only flag hunks whose context lines intersect with upstream diff hunks
6. **Improve `blocked` granularity**: distinguish "patch doesn't apply" (git error) from "patch context shifted" (relocation needed) from "patch target deleted" (true conflict)
7. **Track structural restructures**: detect when upstream moves files to new paths and flag dependent features early

## Reconciliation Process Improvements (lessons learned)

1. **Always verify `upstreamed` verdicts**: After tpatch reconcile, manually check every feature marked `upstreamed` by searching for the actual upstream implementation. Do not trust the verdict without evidence.
2. **Independent review catches what automation misses**: The two false positives were caught by reviewers who simply searched for the expected code. Build this into the reconcile checklist.
3. **Data drift check**: Ensure study.json, metrics.json, and features.jsonl agree on counts. The original data had inconsistent counts (2 vs 3 upstreamed) that went unnoticed until review.

## Post-Review Actions Log (2026-05-15)

### session-search re-applied
The false-positive `upstreamed` verdict was caught by independent reviewers. The feature was re-applied:
- `SessionSearchBar` component restored from pre-reconcile tag
- `chat.search` keybinding added to contracts + shared keybindings
- Search state, memo, and command handler added to ChatView.tsx
- tpatch status reverted to `applied`, patch re-recorded

### copilot-skill-controls implemented (was never actually implemented)
Reviewers noted the feature had only scaffolding code (skill discovery error handling), not the actual enable/disable/reload functionality. Rather than reverting to `requested`, we implemented the full feature:
- `ProviderAdapterShape`: added optional `setSkillEnabled` method
- `CopilotAdapter`: implemented `setSkillEnabled` calling `rpc.skills.enable()`/`disable()` on the SDK
- `ProviderRegistryShape` + `ProviderRegistryLive`: routing through adapter with error recovery
- WS RPC: new `server.setSkillEnabled` endpoint
- Contracts: `WsServerSetSkillEnabledRpc` schema
- tpatch status transitioned: `requested` → `implementing` → `applied`
- Note: Web UI toggle not yet built — server-side plumbing is complete

### Data corrections applied
- `features.jsonl`: ground_truth corrected for both false-positive features
- `metrics.json`: revised verdict accuracy to reflect 0/2 upstreamed correct
- `study.json`: aligned counts (14 applied → 15 applied with skill controls)

### Lessons for next reconciliation
1. Add "verify upstreamed" step to reconcile checklist before merging
2. Request independent review of all upstreamed/retired verdicts
3. Cross-check feature.jsonl counts against study.json before committing
