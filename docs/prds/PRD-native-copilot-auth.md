# PRD — Native GitHub Copilot Auth as a tpatch Provider

**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-04-17
**Owner**: tpatch core
**Target milestones**: M10 (managed proxy UX), M11 (direct PAT provider — opt-in)

## 1. Problem

Today, `tpatch provider set --preset copilot` points at `http://localhost:4141`, which is the [`copilot-api`](https://github.com/tesseracode/copilot-api) proxy — a reverse-engineered translator that exposes GitHub Copilot through an OpenAI-compatible (and now Anthropic-compatible) surface. Users must:

1. Install the proxy themselves (`bun install`, `npm i -g copilot-api`, or Docker).
2. Run it as a background process before tpatch works.
3. Manage OAuth separately (either interactively through the proxy or by supplying `GH_TOKEN`).

Users ask: *"Can I just use the same GitHub account I use with `copilot` CLI?"* The answer today is "yes, but through the proxy." This PRD evaluates what a more native integration would cost, benefit, and risk.

## 2. Research — What is officially supported?

### 2.1 copilot-api (the current dependency)

Directly from the `tesseracode/copilot-api` README:

> **This is a reverse-engineered proxy of GitHub Copilot API. It is not supported by GitHub, and may break unexpectedly. Use at your own risk.**
>
> GitHub Security Notice: Excessive automated or scripted use of Copilot […] may trigger GitHub's abuse-detection systems. You may receive a warning from GitHub Security, and further anomalous activity could result in temporary suspension of your Copilot access.

So copilot-api is **unsupported** and places the user at some risk of account action. It is, however, the most mature working option today.

### 2.2 github/copilot-cli (the official client)

The official Copilot CLI repository (`github/copilot-cli`) contains only `README.md`, `install.sh`, `changelog.md`, and `LICENSE.md`. **No source code is published** — the CLI is distributed as a closed-source binary via Homebrew, npm (`@github/copilot`), WinGet, or the install script. We cannot read its transport logic.

The README documents the official auth options:

1. **Interactive OAuth** via the `/login` slash command.
2. **Personal Access Token** with the `"Copilot Requests"` permission, supplied through `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` env vars.

Neither option exposes a documented OpenAI-compatible endpoint that a third-party Go process can call. The CLI is an interactive TUI; it is not a protocol.

### 2.3 opencode (anomalyco/opencode) — proven in-process pattern

opencode ships an in-process Copilot integration (`packages/opencode/src/plugin/github-copilot/copilot.ts`) that is notably simpler than copilot-api. It does **not** run a proxy and does **not** exchange OAuth tokens for short-lived Copilot session tokens. The flow is:

1. **OAuth device flow against `github.com`** (fully documented, officially supported endpoints):
   - `POST https://github.com/login/device/code` with `client_id=Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz`, `scope=read:user`.
   - Poll `POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` with the device code until `access_token` is returned.
   - `Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz` is the well-known editor-plugin client ID shared across Neovim/Zed/aider/opencode integrations — not a secret and not specific to any one tool.
2. **Use the GitHub OAuth access token directly as Bearer** against `https://api.githubcopilot.com/*`:
   - `GET /models` to enumerate available models.
   - `POST /chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible) or `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic-compatible) for generation.
3. **Editor identification headers**: `User-Agent: opencode/<version>`, `Openai-Intent: conversation-edits`, `x-initiator: user|agent`, optional `Copilot-Vision-Request`.
4. **GitHub Enterprise support**: OAuth against the enterprise domain; Copilot API at `https://copilot-api.<enterprise-domain>`.

Key implication: **copilot-api's session-token dance (`/copilot_internal/v2/token`) is not required** — GitHub honors the raw OAuth access token on `api.githubcopilot.com`. This removes the single biggest source of brittleness we assumed in the earlier draft of this PRD.

opencode is actively maintained, has many thousands of users, and uses this path as its primary Copilot integration — which is the closest thing to "proven by third-party precedent" we can get for an unsanctioned surface.

### 2.4 Conclusion

There is, **as of 2026-04**, no officially documented HTTP endpoint that a tool like tpatch can call to reach GitHub Copilot. Every "native Copilot" path for a non-GitHub tool is either:

- A reverse-engineered endpoint (copilot-api's approach), or
- Shelling out to the `copilot` binary (not a provider, an agent).

## 3. Options Evaluated

| Option | What it is | Officially supported? | Implementation cost | Operational risk | UX |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|----|
| **A. Status quo** | User runs copilot-api, tpatch connects to localhost:4141 | No | Zero (shipped) | Medium — abuse detection applies | Requires external setup |
| **B. Managed proxy** | tpatch auto-installs & manages copilot-api lifecycle | No (same as A) | Medium | Same as A | One-command |
| **C. Native session-token-exchange provider** | tpatch calls `api.githubcopilot.com` directly after OAuth device flow + Copilot session-token exchange — same transport as copilot-api and litellm, but in-process Go | No (endpoint undocumented; auth *is* documented) | Medium (~350–400 LOC Go) | Same as A but without Node dep | `tpatch provider copilot-login` then one-command |
| **D. Shell out to `copilot` CLI** | tpatch spawns `copilot -p <prompt>` per phase | Official | Low | Low — sanctioned, but quota-hungry | Burns premium requests; structured output fragile; copilot re-runs its own agent loop |
| **E. MCP-based** | If Copilot CLI publishes an MCP server mode, tpatch is a client | Speculative | Depends | Low once available | Clean |

## 4. Recommendation

**Two-phase rollout, gated by milestones.**

### Phase 1 — M10: Managed Proxy UX (Option B)

Make the copilot-api path feel native without pretending it is.

- Ship `tpatch provider copilot-start` that:
  1. Checks whether `copilot-api` is runnable (`copilot-api --version` or `npx copilot-api@latest --version`).
  2. If missing, prints install instructions and exits with a helpful error (do **not** silently install — the user must consent to pulling an unsupported proxy).
  3. If present, spawns it as a background process with `--port 4141 --rate-limit 30 --wait` (default rate-limit friendly to GitHub ToS).
  4. Writes the PID to `.tpatch/provider-runtime.json` so `tpatch provider copilot-stop` can cleanly shut it down.
  5. Runs `tpatch provider set --preset copilot` to wire the config.
- Add a **visible warning** on every `tpatch provider copilot-start` run linking to GitHub's Acceptable Use Policy and the copilot-api abuse-detection notice.
- Document in `docs/harnesses/copilot.md` that this is the supported "easy" path.

**Why this first**: it keeps tpatch honest (we don't own the endpoint), reduces setup friction by ~80%, and does not require us to reimplement anything GitHub might change.

### Phase 2 — M11: Native OAuth-device-flow provider (Option C) — feature-flagged, opt-in

For users who don't want a Node proxy running. **Blueprint: port opencode's `CopilotAuthPlugin` to Go.**

- Add `internal/provider/copilot_native.go` implementing the `Provider` interface against `api.githubcopilot.com` directly.
- **Auth**: OAuth device flow against `github.com/login/device/code` + `login/oauth/access_token` using the well-known editor client ID `Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz`. New command `tpatch provider copilot-login` runs the flow once; token stored in `~/.config/tpatch/copilot-auth.json` (chmod 0600) — **not** in `.tpatch/` (which is per-repo).
- **Config**: `type: copilot-native`, `base_url: https://api.githubcopilot.com` (or enterprise variant), no `auth_env` — credentials come from the auth file.
- **Transport**: GitHub OAuth access token used directly as Bearer; no session-token exchange (proven by opencode). Headers: `User-Agent: tpatch/<version>`, `Openai-Intent: conversation-edits`, `x-initiator: agent` (all tpatch calls are agent-initiated from GitHub's perspective since the user is not in the loop).
- **GitHub Enterprise**: same flow with user-supplied domain; Copilot API at `https://copilot-api.<domain>`.
- **Models**: call `GET /models` on first use to discover what the user's Copilot plan exposes; cache in `copilot-auth.json`.
- **Opt-in gate**: must be enabled via `tpatch config set provider.copilot_native_optin true` *and* requires a non-empty warning acknowledgement. First-run prints the full AUP quote.
- Document as experimental; may break; user assumes risk.

**Why opt-in even though opencode does it by default**: opencode is an agentic TUI where the user is in the loop each turn. tpatch calls the same endpoint from a non-interactive agent across four phases per feature, which is a higher-volume usage pattern more likely to trip abuse detection. Making it opt-in preserves user agency.

**Why this is now much cheaper than the earlier draft of this PRD assumed**: opencode proves we do **not** need to reimplement copilot-api's session-token refresh dance. The native provider is essentially `OpenAICompatible` + an extra `x-initiator` header + a device-flow login command.

### Explicitly **not** doing

- **Option D (shell out to `copilot` CLI)**: rejected. Each tpatch phase (analyze/define/explore/implement) would burn a premium request; `copilot` re-enters its own agentic loop which will diverge from our prompt schemas; output parsing on top of a TUI-oriented binary is brittle.
- **Option E (MCP)**: will be reconsidered if/when Copilot CLI or the coding agent publishes an MCP server endpoint. Tracked as a watch item, not work.

## 5. Scope details

### 5.1 New CLI surface

```
tpatch provider copilot-start [--port 4141] [--rate-limit 30]
tpatch provider copilot-stop
tpatch provider copilot-status
```

All three operate on the proxy lifecycle recorded in `.tpatch/provider-runtime.json`. They fail gracefully (exit code, clear message) when:
- `copilot-api` is not installed.
- The managed PID is no longer running.
- Port 4141 is occupied by something else.

### 5.2 `provider-runtime.json` schema

```json
{
  "managed": "copilot-api",
  "pid": 12345,
  "port": 4141,
  "started_at": "2026-04-17T06:55:00Z",
  "started_by": "tpatch/0.3.0",
  "flags": ["--rate-limit", "30", "--wait"]
}
```

Written into `.tpatch/` so it moves with the project. Not tracked in git (added to `.gitignore` by `tpatch init`).

### 5.3 `Provider` interface stability

Unchanged. Both the managed proxy path (Phase 1) and the native PAT path (Phase 2) use the existing `Provider` interface — Phase 1 keeps using `OpenAICompatible`, Phase 2 adds a sibling struct. `NewFromConfig` dispatches on `cfg.Type`.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| GitHub policy action against users driving Copilot from tpatch | Default rate-limit of 30s on managed proxy; prominent AUP warning on every start; require explicit opt-in for Phase 2 native provider |
| copilot-api breaks because GitHub changes its internal API | Pin a tested copilot-api version in the docs; add a `tpatch provider check` diagnostic that detects transport failures and tells the user to update |
| User installs the wrong copilot-api (upstream vs fork) | `copilot-start` checks `copilot-api --version` and warns if not the Tesserabox fork |
| Phase 2 native PAT provider drifts from copilot-api's header set | Mirror copilot-api's known-good headers in a single constants file with links to the upstream source; ship integration tests against `httptest` fixtures |
| Abuse-detection flag on the user's Copilot account | Mandatory AUP acknowledgement on first run; no concurrent in-flight requests (workflow phases are serial anyway) |

## 7. Success Criteria

Phase 1 ships when:

- `tpatch provider copilot-start` goes from "nothing configured" to "working analyze/define/explore/implement" in one command on a machine with copilot-api already installed.
- A user without copilot-api gets a clear, actionable install instruction (not a silent failure).
- `tpatch provider copilot-stop` reliably terminates the managed process.
- Integration test covers the happy path with a mocked `copilot-api` binary on PATH.

Phase 2 ships when:

- `tpatch provider check` against `copilot-native` type returns a non-empty model list via GitHub endpoint directly (no Node proxy running).
- The full analyze → define → explore → implement cycle works against the native provider.
- Explicit opt-in flag must be set; first run displays the AUP warning block.

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Can we legally ship a header set that identifies tpatch as an "editor" to GitHub's Copilot endpoint?** Needs a quick legal/policy check. anomalyco/opencode, ericc-ch/copilot-api, BerriAI/litellm, aider, and Neovim Copilot all ship this pattern openly with no observed action from GitHub, which establishes third-party precedent but is not a legal opinion. If the answer is "no", Phase 2 is blocked and we stay on Phase 1 indefinitely. (See ADR-005, which documents the decision set if/when the answer is "yes".)
2. **Does GitHub plan to publish an official OpenAI-compatible Copilot endpoint?** If yes, Phase 2 gets dropped in favor of the official surface. Worth asking on GitHub's Copilot Discussions before building.
3. **Should `tpatch provider copilot-start` also offer Docker-backed invocation?** A Docker path is lower-friction on Linux servers but heavier on macOS. Probably out of scope for M10; revisit if requested.
4. **Should we use our own OAuth client ID or the shared editor one (`Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz`)?** Using the shared ID matches opencode/Zed/Neovim/aider precedent and is what works today. Registering our own would be cleaner in theory but is likely to be rejected by GitHub for a third-party tool targeting Copilot. Default: use the shared one and document it.

## 9. References

- anomalyco/opencode — `packages/opencode/src/plugin/github-copilot/copilot.ts` (OAuth device flow with client ID `Ov23li8tweQw6odWQebz`, Bearer against `api.githubcopilot.com`, **no** session-token exchange).
- anomalyco/opencode — `packages/opencode/src/plugin/github-copilot/models.ts` (model discovery at `GET /models`).
- ericc-ch/copilot-api — `src/lib/api-config.ts` + `src/services/github/get-device-code.ts` (client ID `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`, session-token exchange via `copilot_internal/v2/token`, full VS Code Copilot Chat impersonation). The upstream of `tesseracode/copilot-api`.
- BerriAI/litellm — `litellm/llms/github_copilot/authenticator.py` (same client ID and token-exchange pattern as copilot-api; tokens persisted to `~/.config/litellm/github_copilot/`).
- github/copilot-cli — closed-source binary; only `/login` OAuth and PAT documented, no HTTP protocol exposed.

## 10. Out of Scope

- Embedding copilot-api as a Go port (rewriting a Node proxy in Go is a separate project — option C's *internal implementation*, not a separate product).
- Token refresh UX beyond what copilot-api already provides.
- Streaming responses (tpatch workflow is request/response; not a TUI).
