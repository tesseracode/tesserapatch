# Tessera Patch — Claude Code Skill

## What This Is

Tessera Patch is a framework for customizing open-source projects through natural-language-driven patching. This skill teaches you the methodology.

## You Are the Provider

The tpatch CLI has two paths for every LLM-driven phase:

- **Path A — CLI-driven.** Run `tpatch <phase> <slug>`; the configured provider generates the artifact; tpatch advances feature state.
- **Path B — Agent-authored.** Author the artifact yourself under `.tpatch/features/<slug>/` following the schemas in this skill; run `tpatch <phase> <slug> --manual` to advance feature state without calling the provider.

**You are the provider** whenever any of these are true:

- No provider is configured (`tpatch provider check` fails).
- The provider returned an empty, truncated, or obviously insufficient response (e.g. a 1-operation `ensure-directory` recipe, missing spec sections, a `write-file` with empty `contents`).
- You have more context about the codebase than the provider does (larger context window, loaded files, recent edits).

Path B is **normal**, not exceptional. Prefer it over re-running Path A with different prompts when you already know what the artifact should contain. Do not wait for a better recipe.

When in doubt, `tpatch status <slug>` tells you what phase you are in. `tpatch next <slug>` tells you what command to run next. Then pick Path A or Path B.

## Invocation

`tpatch` is a compiled Go binary on PATH. Invoke it directly — do NOT wrap it:

- ✓ `tpatch <command>`
- ✗ `npx tpatch …` (not a Node package)
- ✗ `npm run tpatch …` (not an npm script)
- ✗ `python -m tpatch …` (not a Python module)

Always run from the repository root (where `.tpatch/` exists). Do not `cd` to speculative paths — use the current working directory.

## Phase Ordering

```
requested    → tpatch analyze    → analyzed
analyzed     → tpatch define     → defined
defined      → tpatch explore    → defined (exploration.md enriched)
defined      → tpatch implement  → implementing (apply-recipe.json ready)
implementing → tpatch apply --mode execute                          → applied
             OR tpatch apply --mode started / edit / --mode done    → applied
applied      → tpatch record     → active
active       → tpatch reconcile  → active | upstream_merged | blocked
```

Never skip a phase. Never go backwards without `tpatch reconcile`.

## Before You Run Anything

1. `tpatch status <slug>` — see current state and last command.
2. `tpatch next <slug>` — get the exact next command (add `--format harness-json` for structured output).
3. Only then proceed. Do not guess the next phase from file presence.
4. Run tpatch record <slug> BEFORE git commit. If you already committed, use tpatch record <slug> --from <base> — a clean working tree without --from is refused.
5. Run tpatch reconcile only on a CLEAN working tree at the target upstream state. Commit or stash first; reconcile refuses dirty trees, conflict markers, and .orig/.rej leftovers. See docs/reconcile.md for the workflow patterns.

## Phases — Path A and Path B

Each phase below has the same shape: purpose, artifact, Path A command, Path B author-and-advance, quality checklist.

### Phase: analyze

- **Purpose**: Compatibility + impact analysis. Is this feature already upstream? Is it compatible with the project?
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/analysis.md` (plus `artifacts/analysis.json`)
- **Path A**: `tpatch analyze <slug>`
- **Path B**: Write `analysis.md` yourself (summary, compatibility notes, risks). Then `tpatch analyze <slug> --manual` to advance state to `analyzed`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] States clearly whether the feature is already present upstream.
  - [ ] Flags obvious compatibility blockers (language version, framework, license).
  - [ ] One-paragraph summary usable by the reviewer.

### Phase: define

- **Purpose**: Acceptance criteria and an implementation plan.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/spec.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch define <slug>`
- **Path B**: Write `spec.md` yourself (problem statement, acceptance criteria as a numbered list, out-of-scope notes, phased plan). Then `tpatch define <slug> --manual`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] At least one acceptance criterion is a command that can be run.
  - [ ] Out-of-scope is explicit to prevent scope creep.
  - [ ] Plan references files/modules, not invented paths.

### Phase: explore

- **Purpose**: Ground the implementation in real files and symbols.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/exploration.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch explore <slug>`
- **Path B**: Read the codebase with your tools. Write `exploration.md` yourself: relevant files (real paths, not hallucinated), key symbols, insertion points, test locations. Then `tpatch explore <slug> --manual`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Every file path referenced exists in the working tree.
  - [ ] Identifies the smallest changeset that satisfies the spec.
  - [ ] Cites tests that must pass (or must be added).

### Phase: implement

- **Purpose**: Produce a deterministic apply recipe.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/apply-recipe.json`
- **Path A**: `tpatch implement <slug>`
- **Path B**: Author the recipe yourself against the schema below. Then `tpatch implement <slug> --manual` (the flag validates the JSON before advancing state; malformed JSON is refused).
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Every `write-file.path` and `replace-in-file.path` exists in the plan OR is created by a prior op.
  - [ ] `replace-in-file.search` is unique enough to match exactly once.
  - [ ] No `path` escapes the repo root (`../`, absolute path, symlink target outside repo).

### Phase: reconcile

- **Purpose**: Re-evaluate feature against new upstream.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/reconciliation/<commit-range>.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch reconcile [slug...] --upstream-ref <ref>`
- **Path B**: See the 3WayConflicts playbook below — when the CLI returns `3WayConflicts` or `Blocked`, you resolve by hand. (`reconcile --manual` is reserved; the agent-driven reconcile path uses `apply` + `record` against the new upstream.)
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Working tree is clean before running reconcile.
  - [ ] Upstream commit the reconcile ran against is recorded in `upstream.lock`.

## apply-recipe.json schema

The `implement` phase produces a deterministic recipe that the `apply` phase consumes. When authoring manually, follow this schema exactly.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "operations": [
    { "op": "ensure-directory", "path": "src/feature/" },
    { "op": "write-file",
      "path": "src/feature/new.ts",
      "contents": "export function greet(name: string) {\n  return `hello ${name}`;\n}\n"
    },
    { "op": "replace-in-file",
      "path": "src/index.ts",
      "search": "export * from \"./legacy\";\n",
      "replace": "export * from \"./legacy\";\nexport * from \"./feature/new\";\n",
      "occurrences": 1
    },
    { "op": "delete-file", "path": "src/dead.ts" }
  ]
}
```

### Operations

- **`ensure-directory`** `{ path }` — create the directory if missing. No-op if present.
- **`write-file`** `{ path, contents }` — write the full file. Overwrites existing content.
- **`replace-in-file`** `{ path, search, replace, occurrences? }` — replace one (or N) occurrences of `search` with `replace`.
- **`delete-file`** `{ path }` — remove the file if present.

### Semantics

- `replace-in-file.search` is a **literal string match, not a regex**. Escape nothing; paste the exact text you want to replace including surrounding lines for uniqueness.
- `occurrences` defaults to `1`. Set it to a positive integer to replace multiple copies, or `-1` to replace every occurrence.
- Include several surrounding lines in `search` when the same string appears more than once in the file.
- All `path` values are repo-relative. tpatch enforces path safety via `EnsureSafeRepoPath`; any `../`, absolute path, or symlink target outside the repo aborts `apply --mode execute`.
- Operations are executed in the order they appear. Later ops may depend on earlier ops (e.g. `ensure-directory` before `write-file`).

## If reconcile returns 3WayConflicts

When `tpatch reconcile` cannot forward-apply cleanly, it returns verdict `3WayConflicts` and stashes the pre-reconcile tree. Automatic provider-assisted resolution is coming (see `docs/adrs/ADR-010-provider-conflict-resolver.md`). Until it ships, resolve by hand using this playbook.

1. **Never pop the stash.** The stash holds your pre-reconcile tree. Popping it destroys upstream's state.
2. Restore only the tpatch metadata so you can see the feature's intent:
   ```
   git checkout stash@{0}^3 -- .tpatch/
   ```
   This pulls `.tpatch/` from the third parent of the reconcile stash (the index that contains your feature artifacts) without touching any other file.
3. Read intent and diff:
   - `.tpatch/features/<slug>/spec.md` — what the feature must achieve.
   - `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/post-apply.patch` — the current canonical diff.
4. Read the new upstream version of each conflicted file.
5. Hand-author a resolution that preserves **both** intents: the feature's intent from `spec.md` AND the upstream change.
6. Forward-apply: edit the files directly in the working tree; tpatch does not need to drive this.
7. Once the tree is clean and the feature works, run:
   ```
   tpatch apply <slug> --mode execute         # or --mode started / --mode done if you authored ad-hoc
   tpatch record <slug>
   ```
8. The `post-apply.patch` is rewritten; the recipe is regenerated on the next `implement`.

## Patch vs recipe — mental model

Two files describe your feature. They play different roles:

- `artifacts/post-apply.patch` — a git diff. This is the **authoritative description of what changed**. The patch captures intent.
- `artifacts/apply-recipe.json` — a deterministic script that produces the patch *against a specific upstream snapshot*.

When they disagree — e.g. the recipe's `replace-in-file` can no longer find its anchor because upstream edited the line — **trust the patch**. The recipe is one way to apply the change; the patch is what you want applied. During reconcile and manual conflict resolution, read the patch to understand intent; regenerate the recipe afterward.

## Feature States

```
requested → analyzed → defined → implementing → applied → active
                                                     ↓
                                               reconciling → active / upstream_merged / blocked
```

## Safety

- Path traversal protection on all file writes (`EnsureSafeRepoPath`)
- Secret-by-reference: config stores env var name, not the token
- Patches exclude `.tpatch/`, skill directories, and framework files
- Deterministic apply recipes can be reviewed before execution
- `reconcile` refuses dirty trees, conflict markers, and `*.orig|*.rej` leftovers
