# Tessera Patch — Claude Code Skill

## What This Is

Tessera Patch is a framework for customizing open-source projects through natural-language-driven patching. This skill teaches you the methodology.

## You Are the Provider

The tpatch CLI has two paths for every LLM-driven phase:

- **Path A — CLI-driven.** Run `tpatch <phase> <slug>`; the configured provider generates the artifact; tpatch advances feature state.
- **Path B — Agent-authored.** Author the artifact yourself under `.tpatch/features/<slug>/` following the schemas in this skill; run `tpatch <phase> <slug> --manual` to advance feature state without calling the provider.

**You are the provider** whenever any of these are true:

- No provider is configured (`tpatch provider check` fails).
- The provider returned an empty, truncated, or obviously insufficient response (e.g. a 1-operation `ensure-directory` recipe, missing spec sections, a `write-file` with empty `contents`).
- You have more context about the codebase than the provider does (larger context window, loaded files, recent edits).

Path B is **normal**, not exceptional. Prefer it over re-running Path A with different prompts when you already know what the artifact should contain. Do not wait for a better recipe.

When in doubt, `tpatch status <slug>` tells you what phase you are in. `tpatch next <slug>` tells you what command to run next. Then pick Path A or Path B.

## Invocation

`tpatch` is a compiled Go binary on PATH. Invoke it directly — do NOT wrap it:

- ✓ `tpatch <command>`
- ✗ `npx tpatch …` (not a Node package)
- ✗ `npm run tpatch …` (not an npm script)
- ✗ `python -m tpatch …` (not a Python module)

Always run from the repository root (where `.tpatch/` exists). Do not `cd` to speculative paths — use the current working directory.

## Phase Ordering

```
requested    → tpatch analyze    → analyzed
analyzed     → tpatch define     → defined
defined      → tpatch explore    → defined (exploration.md enriched)
defined      → tpatch implement  → implementing (apply-recipe.json ready)
implementing → tpatch apply                                         → applied
             OR tpatch apply --mode started / edit / --mode done    → applied (advanced)
applied      → tpatch record     → active
active       → tpatch reconcile  → active | upstream_merged | blocked
```

Never skip a phase. Never go backwards without `tpatch reconcile`.
Retirement audit: after a feature is confirmed upstreamed, `tpatch reconcile confirm-upstreamed <slug> [--json|--format json]` confirms the upstreamed outcome, runs the retirement audit, and appends cleanup-needed follow-ups; `tpatch reconcile audit-retirement <slug> [--json]` reports stale dependency/base metadata without mutating feature state.


## Verify (freshness overlay)

**Verify before composing.** When you finish `tpatch apply` and want a cheap, machine-checkable signal that the feature is structurally healthy, run `tpatch verify <slug>`. Verify writes a freshness record on the feature; downstream readers see a `verified-fresh` label until the recipe, patch, or any hard parent's state drifts, at which point the label flips to `verified-stale`. The lifecycle state is never changed by verify — `applied` stays `applied`. Verify is read-only on the working tree. It does **not** run the project's test suite; for that, use `tpatch test`.

Run `tpatch verify --all` to walk every tracked feature in topological order; pre-apply features are reported with a `skipped: pre-apply` row at their topo position. Non-zero exit if any feature failed.

If `tpatch status` reports `dependent-broken`, a downstream feature's base SHA is no longer reachable — re-record affected features on the new base or run `tpatch reconcile`.

If you need to correct an already-recorded feature patch, use `tpatch feature patch refresh <slug> [--reason "..."]` for the same logical patch or `tpatch feature patch fixup <slug> --reason "..."` for an explicit fixup generation (the target generation is auto-derived from the manifest). Plain `tpatch record <slug>` remains compatible; later byte-changing records are tracked as refreshes. If `tpatch status` reports `parent-generation-stale`, refresh or reconcile downstream features against the parent's current generation.

## Before You Run Anything

1. `tpatch status <slug>` — see current state and last command.
2. `tpatch next <slug>` — get the exact next command (add `--format harness-json` for structured output).
3. Only then proceed. Do not guess the next phase from file presence.
4. Run tpatch record <slug> BEFORE git commit. If you already committed, prefer tpatch record <slug> --auto (infers base from .tpatch/upstream.lock + merge-base); fall back to tpatch record <slug> --from <base> when --auto refuses (ambiguous merge-base or empty lock). A clean working tree without --auto/--from is refused. Or run `tpatch land <slug>` to compose record + safe-stage (limits the index to the feature's apply path set plus `.tpatch/features/<slug>/`) + one Git commit carrying the locked four-trailer block (`Tpatch-Feature`, `Tpatch-Patch-SHA`, `Tpatch-Recipe-SHA`, `Tpatch-Base-Commit`) plus the repo `Co-authored-by:` trailer. Use `--dry-run` to preview without mutating; use `--allow-extra-paths` to opt into staging dirty paths outside the feature scope.
5. Run tpatch reconcile only on a CLEAN working tree at the target upstream state. Commit or stash first; reconcile refuses dirty trees, conflict markers, mid-merge state, and `*.orig` / `*.rej` leftovers. Reconcile is a mutating operation (it can replay patches and update `.tpatch/` artifacts), so re-run `tpatch record` afterwards to capture any changes.

## Phases — Path A and Path B

Each phase below has the same shape: purpose, artifact, Path A command, Path B author-and-advance, quality checklist.

### Phase: analyze

- **Purpose**: Compatibility + impact analysis. Is this feature already upstream? Is it compatible with the project?
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/analysis.md` (plus `artifacts/analysis.json`)
- **Path A**: `tpatch analyze <slug>`
- **Path B**: Write `analysis.md` yourself (summary, compatibility notes, risks). Then `tpatch analyze <slug> --manual` to advance state to `analyzed`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] States clearly whether the feature is already present upstream.
  - [ ] Flags obvious compatibility blockers (language version, framework, license).
  - [ ] One-paragraph summary usable by the reviewer.

### Phase: define

- **Purpose**: Acceptance criteria and an implementation plan.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/spec.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch define <slug>`
- **Path B**: Write `spec.md` yourself (problem statement, acceptance criteria as a numbered list, out-of-scope notes, phased plan). Then `tpatch define <slug> --manual`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] At least one acceptance criterion is a command that can be run.
  - [ ] Out-of-scope is explicit to prevent scope creep.
  - [ ] Plan references files/modules, not invented paths.

### Phase: explore

- **Purpose**: Ground the implementation in real files and symbols.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/exploration.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch explore <slug>`
- **Path B**: Read the codebase with your tools. Write `exploration.md` yourself: relevant files (real paths, not hallucinated), key symbols, insertion points, test locations. Then `tpatch explore <slug> --manual`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Every file path referenced exists in the working tree.
  - [ ] Identifies the smallest changeset that satisfies the spec.
  - [ ] Cites tests that must pass (or must be added).

### Phase: implement

- **Purpose**: Produce a deterministic apply recipe.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/apply-recipe.json`
- **Path A**: `tpatch implement <slug>`
- **Path B**: Author the recipe yourself against the schema below. Then `tpatch implement <slug> --manual` (the flag validates the JSON before advancing state; malformed JSON is refused).
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Every `write-file.path` and `replace-in-file.path` exists in the plan OR is created by a prior op.
  - [ ] `replace-in-file.search` is unique enough to match exactly once.
  - [ ] No `path` escapes the repo root (`../`, absolute path, symlink target outside repo).

### Phase: reconcile

- **Purpose**: Re-evaluate feature against new upstream.
- **Artifact**: `.tpatch/features/<slug>/reconciliation/<commit-range>.md`
- **Path A**: `tpatch reconcile [slug...] --upstream-ref <ref>`
- **Path B**: See the 3WayConflicts playbook below — when the CLI returns `3WayConflicts` or `Blocked`, you resolve by hand. (`reconcile --manual` is reserved; the agent-driven reconcile path uses `apply` + `record` against the new upstream.)
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Working tree is clean before running reconcile.
  - [ ] Upstream commit the reconcile ran against is recorded in `upstream.lock`.

## apply-recipe.json schema

The `implement` phase produces a deterministic recipe that the `apply` phase consumes. When authoring manually, follow this schema exactly.

```json
{
  "feature": "<slug>",
  "operations": [
    { "type": "ensure-directory", "path": "src/feature/" },
    { "type": "write-file",
      "path": "src/feature/new.ts",
      "content": "export function greet(name: string) {\n  return `hello ${name}`;\n}\n"
    },
    { "type": "replace-in-file",
      "path": "src/index.ts",
      "search": "export * from \"./legacy\";\n",
      "replace": "export * from \"./legacy\";\nexport * from \"./feature/new\";\n"
    },
    { "type": "append-file",
      "path": "src/changelog.md",
      "content": "\n- added feature/new\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Operations

- **`ensure-directory`** `{ path }` — create the directory if missing. No-op if present.
- **`write-file`** `{ path, content }` — write the full file. Overwrites existing content.
- **`replace-in-file`** `{ path, search, replace }` — replace the first occurrence of `search` with `replace`. Errors if `search` is not found.
- **`append-file`** `{ path, content }` — append to an existing file. Errors if the file does not exist.

### Semantics

- `replace-in-file.search` is a **literal string match, not a regex**. Escape nothing; paste the exact text you want to replace including surrounding lines for uniqueness.
- `replace-in-file` replaces exactly one occurrence per operation. To replace multiple copies, emit multiple `replace-in-file` ops — each will target the next occurrence since prior ops rewrote the file.
- Include several surrounding lines in `search` when the same string appears more than once in the file, so the match is unique.
- All `path` values are repo-relative. tpatch enforces path safety via `EnsureSafeRepoPath`; any `../`, absolute path, or symlink target outside the repo aborts `apply --mode execute`.
- Operations are executed in the order they appear. Later ops may depend on earlier ops (e.g. `ensure-directory` before `write-file`).
- There is no `delete-file` or `rename-file` op in the current schema. To delete a file, use Path B: `apply --mode started`, `git rm <path>`, `apply --mode done`, `record`. Richer ops are tracked in `feat-recipe-schema-expansion`.

### Optional fields

- **`created_by`** — optional string on any operation. Value is the parent feature slug whose patch originally created this file. From v0.6.0 this is a **live apply-time gate**: `tpatch apply --mode execute` rejects an op whose `created_by` parent is missing from the recipe's `depends_on` (hard-parent miss is fatal in execute, warning in `--dry-run`). Omit when the feature has no DAG provenance to declare.

## Feature dependencies (v0.6.0+)

Tessera Patch tracks a dependency DAG between features. Declare parents in `status.json` `depends_on`, or via the CLI:

- `tpatch feature deps <slug>` — print depends_on + dependents.
- `tpatch feature deps <slug> add <parent>[:hard|:soft]` — add an edge (defaults to hard).
- `tpatch feature deps <slug> remove <parent>` — remove an edge (atomic).
- `tpatch amend <slug> --depends-on <parent>[:hard|:soft]` — same, in batch with other edits.
- `tpatch amend <slug> --remove-depends-on <parent>` — same, in batch.
- `tpatch feature deps --validate-all` — global validation (cycles, dangling, kind conflict).
- `tpatch status --dag` (add `--json` for harnesses) — render the DAG tree. Add a slug to scope to one feature's parents + children.

Edge kinds:

- **hard** (default) — `tpatch apply <child>` is blocked until every hard parent reaches state `applied` or `upstream_merged`.
- **soft** — ordering hint only; never gates apply.

Composable reconcile labels overlay on `Reconcile.Outcome`:

- `waiting-on-parent` — at least one hard parent has not yet been applied.
- `blocked-by-parent` — at least one hard parent is in a terminal-failure verdict.
- `stale-parent-applied` — a hard parent was updated after the child's last reconcile.
- Compound: when the child's own outcome is `blocked-requires-human` AND `blocked-by-parent` is set, `EffectiveOutcome` reports `blocked-by-parent-and-needs-resolution` (display-only — programmatic decisions still read `Outcome` and `Labels` separately).

Recipe operations may set `created_by: "<parent-slug>"` to declare DAG provenance. From v0.6.0 this is a **live apply-time gate**: `tpatch apply --mode execute` rejects an operation whose `created_by` parent is missing from `depends_on` (hard fail in execute, downgraded to a warning in `--dry-run` per PRD §4.3).

Removing a feature with downstream dependents requires `--cascade`:

- `tpatch remove <slug>` — refuses if any dependent exists.
- `tpatch remove <slug> --cascade` — TTY confirms, then removes leaves first (reverse-topological order).
- `tpatch remove <slug> --cascade --force` — required for non-TTY use.
- **`--force` alone never bypasses the dep-integrity gate** — it only suppresses the TTY confirm prompt (PRD §3.7, ADR-011 D7).

Toggle the whole feature with `features_dependencies: true|false` in `.tpatch/config.yaml` (default `true` from v0.6.0).

## Reconcile Phase 3.5 — Provider-assisted conflict resolution (v0.5.0)

On 3-way conflict, `tpatch reconcile --resolve` asks the provider to merge each conflicted file inside a **shadow worktree** (`.tpatch/shadow/<slug>-<ts>/`). The real working tree is never touched until you accept.

### Flags

- `--resolve` — enable phase 3.5 (off by default; no heuristic fallback — ADR-010 D9).
- `--apply` — auto-accept when every file is `resolved`. Requires `--resolve`.
- `--max-conflicts N` — abort before calling the provider if conflicts > N (default 10).
- `--model <name>` — override the resolver model for this run.
- `--accept <slug>` / `--reject <slug>` / `--shadow-diff <slug>` — terminal operations on a pending shadow session. Mutually exclusive; take `<slug>` as the flag value, not a positional arg.

### Verdicts beyond v0.4.x

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `shadow-awaiting` | All conflicted files resolved; shadow ready for `--accept`. Feature state: `reconciling-shadow`. |
| `blocked-requires-human` | At least one file failed validation (still has `<<<<<<<` markers, corrupted output, or no provider configured). |
| `blocked-too-many-conflicts` | Conflict count exceeded `--max-conflicts`; the provider was never called. |

### resolution-session.json

Each resolver run writes `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/resolution-session.json` (renamed from `reconcile-session.json` in v0.5.3 — that path is now the high-level reconcile summary). Shape:

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-22T12:00:00Z",
  "upstream_commit": "<sha>",
  "shadow_path": ".tpatch/shadow/<slug>-<ts>/",
  "files": [
    { "path": "src/a.ts", "status": "resolved", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "validation": "ok" },
    { "path": "src/b.ts", "status": "failed",   "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "validation": "markers" }
  ],
  "verdict": "shadow-awaiting"
}
```

Agents acting as the provider (Path B) can read this file, edit the shadow files directly, then run `tpatch reconcile --accept <slug>` to commit the resolution.

### Accept flow (what `--accept` actually does)

1. Apply non-conflicting hunks of `post-apply.patch` to the real tree via 3-way merge (excluding the resolved files).
2. Copy the resolved files from the shadow worktree over the real tree.
3. Regenerate `artifacts/post-apply.patch` as `git diff <upstreamCommit> -- <touched files>`.
4. Snapshot the resolution delta as `patches/NNN-reconcile.patch` (audit trail).
5. Mark state `applied`; prune the shadow worktree.

`apply-recipe.json` is NOT auto-regenerated (lossy from a raw diff). Re-run `tpatch implement` or `tpatch record` if the recipe matters to you.

## If reconcile returns 3WayConflicts

When `tpatch reconcile` cannot forward-apply cleanly, it returns verdict `3WayConflicts` and stashes the pre-reconcile tree. In v0.5.0 the fastest path is `tpatch reconcile --resolve` (see Phase 3.5 above). The manual playbook below remains the fallback when you prefer to resolve by hand or when phase 3.5 returns `blocked-requires-human`.

1. **Never pop the stash.** The stash holds your pre-reconcile tree. Popping it destroys upstream's state.
2. Restore only the tpatch metadata so you can see the feature's intent:
   ```
   git checkout stash@{0}^3 -- .tpatch/
   ```
   This pulls `.tpatch/` from the third parent of the reconcile stash (the index that contains your feature artifacts) without touching any other file.
3. Read intent and diff:
   - `.tpatch/features/<slug>/spec.md` — what the feature must achieve.
   - `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/post-apply.patch` — the current canonical diff.
4. Read the new upstream version of each conflicted file.
5. Hand-author a resolution that preserves **both** intents: the feature's intent from `spec.md` AND the upstream change.
6. Forward-apply: edit the files directly in the working tree; tpatch does not need to drive this.
7. Once the tree is clean and the feature works, run:
   ```
   tpatch apply <slug>                          # auto runs prepare→execute→done; or use --mode started / --mode done if you authored ad-hoc
   tpatch record <slug>
   ```
8. The `post-apply.patch` is rewritten; the recipe is regenerated on the next `implement`.

## Patch vs recipe — mental model

Two files describe your feature. They play different roles:

- `artifacts/post-apply.patch` — a git diff. This is the **authoritative description of what changed**. The patch captures intent.
- `artifacts/apply-recipe.json` — a deterministic script that produces the patch *against a specific upstream snapshot*.

When they disagree — e.g. the recipe's `replace-in-file` can no longer find its anchor because upstream edited the line — **trust the patch**. The recipe is one way to apply the change; the patch is what you want applied. During reconcile and manual conflict resolution, read the patch to understand intent; regenerate the recipe afterward.

```

## Safety

- Path traversal protection on all file writes (`EnsureSafeRepoPath`)
- Secret-by-reference: config stores env var name, not the token
- Patches exclude `.tpatch/`, skill directories, and framework files
- Deterministic apply recipes can be reviewed before execution
- `reconcile` refuses dirty trees, conflict markers, and `*.orig|*.rej` leftovers
