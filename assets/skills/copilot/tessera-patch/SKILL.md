# Tessera Patch — GitHub Copilot Skill

## Overview

Tessera Patch customizes open-source projects through natural-language patches while maintaining upstream compatibility.

## Invocation

`tpatch` is a compiled Go binary on PATH. Invoke it directly — do NOT wrap it:

- ✓ `tpatch <command>`
- ✗ `npx tpatch …` (not a Node package)
- ✗ `npm run tpatch …` (not an npm script)
- ✗ `python -m tpatch …` (not a Python module)

Always run from the repository root (where `.tpatch/` exists). Do not `cd` to speculative paths — use the current working directory.

## Phase Ordering

```
requested    → tpatch analyze    → analyzed
analyzed     → tpatch define     → defined
defined      → tpatch explore    → defined (exploration.md enriched)
defined      → tpatch implement  → implementing (apply-recipe.json ready)
implementing → tpatch apply --mode execute                          → applied
             OR tpatch apply --mode started / edit / --mode done    → applied
applied      → tpatch record     → active
active       → tpatch reconcile  → active | upstream_merged | blocked
```

Never skip a phase. Never go backwards without `tpatch reconcile`.

## Before You Run Anything

1. `tpatch status <slug>` — see current state and last command.
2. `tpatch next <slug>` — get the exact next command (add `--format harness-json` for structured output).
3. Only then proceed. Do not guess the next phase from file presence.
4. Run tpatch record <slug> BEFORE git commit. If you already committed, use tpatch record <slug> --from <base> — a clean working tree without --from is refused.
5. Run tpatch reconcile only on a CLEAN working tree at the target upstream state. Commit or stash first; reconcile refuses dirty trees, conflict markers, and .orig/.rej leftovers. See docs/reconcile.md for the workflow patterns.

## CLI Commands

- `tpatch init` — Initialize workspace
- `tpatch add <description>` — Create feature request
- `tpatch status` — Feature dashboard
- `tpatch analyze <slug>` — Run analysis
- `tpatch define <slug>` — Generate acceptance criteria
- `tpatch explore <slug>` — Explore codebase
- `tpatch implement <slug>` — Generate apply recipe
- `tpatch apply <slug>` — Execute recipe or record session
- `tpatch record <slug>` — Capture patches
- `tpatch reconcile` — Reconcile with upstream
- `tpatch provider check` — Validate provider
- `tpatch config show|set` — Manage config
- `tpatch cycle <slug>` — Run analyze→define→explore→implement→apply→record in sequence (batch or `--interactive`)
- `tpatch test <slug>` — Run the configured `test_command` and record the outcome
- `tpatch next <slug>` — Emit the next action for a feature (`--format harness-json` for structured consumption)

## Lifecycle

analyse → define → explore → implement → test → record → reconcile

## Data Model

Features are tracked in `.tpatch/features/<slug>/` with `status.json`, `request.md`, `analysis.md`, `spec.md`, and `artifacts/`.

## Reconciliation

4-phase decision tree: reverse-apply → operation-level → provider-semantic → forward-apply.

Outcomes: `upstream_merged`, `reapplied`, `blocked`.

## You Are the Provider

Every LLM phase has two paths:

- **Path A — CLI-driven**: `tpatch <phase> <slug>` — configured provider generates the artifact.
- **Path B — Agent-authored**: author the artifact yourself under `.tpatch/features/<slug>/`, then `tpatch <phase> <slug> --manual` to advance feature state without calling the provider.

You are the provider when no provider is configured, the provider returns empty/truncated/insufficient output (common with implement — 1-op stubs, ensure-directory-only, truncated JSON), or you have more context than it does. Path B is normal, not exceptional — do not wait for a better recipe.

Phase → artifact → state contract (the `--manual` flag validates this):

| phase | artifact | advances state to |
|---|---|---|
| analyze | `analysis.md` | `analyzed` |
| define | `spec.md` | `defined` |
| explore | `exploration.md` | `defined` |
| implement | `artifacts/apply-recipe.json` (JSON-validated) | `implementing` |

## apply-recipe.json schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "operations": [
    { "op": "ensure-directory", "path": "src/feature/" },
    { "op": "write-file", "path": "src/a.ts", "contents": "export const x = 1;\n" },
    { "op": "replace-in-file", "path": "src/b.ts",
      "search": "export * from \"./legacy\";\n",
      "replace": "export * from \"./legacy\";\nexport * from \"./feature/a\";\n",
      "occurrences": 1 },
    { "op": "delete-file", "path": "src/dead.ts" }
  ]
}
```

Semantics:

- `replace-in-file.search` is a **literal string match, not a regex**. Paste the exact text, include surrounding lines for uniqueness.
- `occurrences` defaults to `1`; `-1` means every occurrence.
- All `path` values are repo-relative. `../`, absolute paths, or symlinks outside the repo abort `apply --mode execute` (`EnsureSafeRepoPath`).
- Operations execute in order; later ops may depend on earlier ops.

## Patch vs recipe — mental model

- `artifacts/post-apply.patch` — authoritative git diff. **The patch captures intent.**
- `artifacts/apply-recipe.json` — deterministic script targeting a specific upstream snapshot.

When they disagree (e.g. the recipe's `replace-in-file` can no longer find its anchor because upstream edited the line), trust the patch. Regenerate the recipe afterward.

## If reconcile returns 3WayConflicts

1. **Never pop the stash.** It holds your pre-reconcile tree.
2. Restore only the tpatch metadata so you can see the feature's intent:
   `git checkout stash@{0}^3 -- .tpatch/`
3. Read `.tpatch/features/<slug>/spec.md` (intent), `.tpatch/features/<slug>/artifacts/post-apply.patch` (diff), and the new upstream version of each conflicted file.
4. Hand-author a resolution that preserves **both** intents.
5. `tpatch apply <slug> --mode done && tpatch record <slug>`.

Provider-assisted automation of this playbook is tracked in `docs/adrs/ADR-010-provider-conflict-resolver.md` (v0.5.0 headline).
